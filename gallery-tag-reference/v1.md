Because my gallery is sorted mainly by year, so here’s some actual categorization~  
Tags ordered alphabetically within groupings.

- BY <b>SUBJECT</b>
	- recurring stories
		- [disastercrew](https://www.deviantart.com/nightauctor/gallery?q=%23disastercrew): the disaster duo, two of my oldest human characters (since ~2012), plus other people who spawned when I revisited their story in 2018
		- [thefirebirdeffect](https://www.deviantart.com/nightauctor/gallery?q=%23thefirebirdeffect)/[tfe](https://www.deviantart.com/nightauctor/gallery?q=%23tfe): nuzlocke-inspired pokémon comic, active 2016–17
		- [404](https://www.deviantart.com/nightauctor/gallery?q=%23404): experimental web-based narrative, launched 2020 (currently in limbo)
		- [unmooredrandos](https://www.deviantart.com/a-flyleaf/gallery?q=%23unmooredrandos): catch-all tag for <i>You’re gonna be the death of me</i>, a story that I’ve been playing with/developing since early 2021; major site art tagged with [the acronym](https://www.deviantart.com/a-flyleaf/gallery?q=%23ygbtdm)

- tags that I don’t anticipate using again: [livestreamera](https://www.deviantart.com/nightauctor/gallery?q=%23livestreamera), [stevenuniverse](https://www.deviantart.com/nightauctor/gallery?q=%23stevenuniverse), [cringetober](https://www.deviantart.com/nightauctor/gallery?q=%23cringetober)

**Why this?**  
Essentially: I’ve tried sorting my gallery by subject or even style before, but 1) I don’t like gallery repeats for some reason, 2) stuff overlaps a lot, and 3) if I wanted to change the criteria, moving everything was a pain. When dA first introduced tags I think I used them, but then a layout change hid them and somewhere in the interim I just cleared everything?? Idek, man.

In any case, the by-year system is most objective—but it makes finding anything *specific* a pain in the ass instead. Since I started being more active on dA again in 2021 (and tags seem here to stay), figured I’d do this ᕕ( ᐛ )ᕗ

**\*A note on roundups**
[Compilations](https://www.deviantart.com/a-flyleaf/gallery/81345929/compilation-stuff) encompass A Lot Of Stuff. Sometimes I add specific tags (either of note or that I happened to remember pop up somewhere); usually I don’t. Until I make up my mind here, these deviations will come up sporadically in other tags.
