- [untagged](https://www.deviantart.com/nightauctor/gallery?q=%23untagged): stuff I didn’t know what (else) to tag as**
- tags that I don’t anticipate using again: [livestreamera](https://www.deviantart.com/nightauctor/gallery?q=%23livestreamera), [stevenuniverse](https://www.deviantart.com/nightauctor/gallery?q=%23stevenuniverse), [cringetober](https://www.deviantart.com/nightauctor/gallery?q=%23cringetober)
- [icon](https://www.deviantart.com/a-flyleaf/gallery?q=%23icon): art that I’ve used as my dA icon over the years, because why not. (forgot what the very first one was, though…)

*I’ve sorted my gallery different ways over the years; in Ye Olde Times Way Back Whene, I was going for by-subject or sometimes by-style, but stuff overlaps and things being in multiple galleries irritates me & makes future re-sorting a pain in the ass. At one point I was tagging things but then dA changed the layout, hid those tags, and for whatever reason I decided to wipe everything but my username??

The current by-year system is the most objective, but it *also* makes finding anything *specific* a pain in the ass instead. Since I’ve been more active around here lately, figured I’d actually start using tags again.

**For now I’ve filed annual roundups and sketchdumps under “untagged” too, since those can feature a whole truckload of stuff. Might change this in the future?

There’s also a [tumblrlink](https://www.deviantart.com/nightauctor/gallery?q=%23tumblrlink) tag, which is mostly for my own future reference; I’ve changed blogs & urls multiple times and have since left the hellsite, so most if not all the links in these descriptions are broken. Maybe one of these days I’ll repost stuff from my art/doodle tags but don’t hold your breath :V
