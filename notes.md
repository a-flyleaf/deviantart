- post backup is NOT COMPREHENSIVE, memes and stream announcements and other little social things are ephemeral and if they disappeared into the internet void someday I wouldn't be too upset
- that said I don't plan on making (m)any of them public, they're mostly just here for personal backup reasons. maybe someday I'll go back and snag em all but not today
- data is "da-posts" as not to mess with jekyll's blog defaults

- dates are EST as given onsite; YYYY-MM-DD HH:MM (seconds not given, hour in military)
- HTML has been copied as shown, with zero edits; may need to add a pre/post-eclipse variable, or just base it on the date eclipse released (I made a post about it)
	- ok there are *small* edits to get rid of dA's auto-classes, and idk how I handled <br>s at the time so I just spaced them as they appear in the element inspector
	- also found a couple stray "&nbsp"s that... were they line breaks? I can't tell, but I've made them line breaks; differentiated as a "<br/>" (with the slash)
	- eclipse kicked in at some point in 2019/2020, using markdown from there
- images like icons and emojis are hyperlinked to the dA resource, stuff that's /mine/ will get saved

- added a little (OPTIONAL) data bit for modern-day footnotes. just for the heck of it
- also optional type for status updates, else default journal; no title on these, just use the date
	- whoops now there are polls. just stuck that in data too, idk how to handle those either
	- footnote =/= comment data
- dunno how to handle the sta.sh image on the "eclipse Bad(TM)" journal, it's a raw image for now

- urls should be just the slug, gonna see if I can do that without having to have a separate slug attribute (basically like the ygbtdm/toyshelf galleries but automated)...
- trying to avoid using url include everywhere, getting used to relative urls instead

! replace dA links with local/onsite ones
