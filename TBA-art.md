Firebird and a talonflame~

It is 2024 and I am once again having a pokémon moment. I didn't think I'd ever have another pokémon moment. Anyway, feels like I haven't drawn a nice finished fullbody in 5,000 years, and I've been thinking about this kid again so here she is but older. Vaguely post-story.

In retrospect I was *incredibly* tame with the extent of The Damages (read: Sustained Physical Injury). Facial scarring and a lost hand are small potatoes considering the climax involved a literal explosion. Don't be surprised if she looks a little worse for wear if/when I draw her again :V

SCRAPES OFF 500 YEARS OF ARTISTIC RUST

Uh, hi, dA! As of writing I haven’t uploaded anything for 3 months, and it’s been *substantially* longer since I was last ~active. Haven’t even finished rounding up my art from 2023, smh. My hobbies took a sharp detour for a hot minute there, but I think we’re scraping back to the previous normal. Have a grub-lizard.

Uses a similar style as [some](https://www.deviantart.com/a-flyleaf/art/spiral-go-whrrr-895271146) [previous](https://www.deviantart.com/a-flyleaf/art/leafs-898505866) [dragons](https://www.deviantart.com/a-flyleaf/art/shine-bright-like-a-foo-dog-899415043), but with airbrushing & gradients instead of blending. I generally like how blended colors look better, but as a “warmup” it did the job and then some. I’m pretty happy with how it turned out, afterthought backdrop and all!

Time taken: ~3h50m. Features [PolyjuicePotion](https://www1.flightrising.com/clan-profile/644770)’s [Solregem](https://www1.flightrising.com/dragon/99810096), spotted via [dragon drawing thread](https://www1.flightrising.com/forums/permalink/reply/58221689).

[+also I counted the legs wrong lol IGNOrE THAT,,,,]

Have I mentioned I’ve been thinking about this kid again? I’ve been thinking about this kid again. And with new ~thoughts~ comes new brands of ✨hell✨, inevitably. Like getting hands back, in exchange for more substantial scarring!

Anyway. Not a teaser or anything because I make no promises, guarantees, etc. etc. I've mostly just been revisiting the story while finally making [a site for it](), on and off. Also been a while since I drew something for myself, so \o/


Time taken: ~3h30m. Spiritual successor of sorts to [this (less scribbly) prominent-silhouette-frame-with-dramatic-lighting thing](https://a-flyleaf.github.io/ygbtdm/gallery/teef) and, less intentionally, [a much, *much* older drawing of the same kid with a not-yet-bugbird](https://www.deviantart.com/a-flyleaf/art/tweet-tweet-sucker-665030717).

Long time no finished standalone art! Got inspired by an [unused storyboard](https://imginn.com/p/DQ1_qHaiEmt/). I've done a small boatload of style studies (and this face in particular, ngl) over the past several months and I'm pretty dang proud of how this turned out :3c

Did not time, but based on internet history timestamps I'd wager about ~5 hours on and off. A non-small amount of that time was painting sections of the face and hands that ended up getting covered, but it was good blending practice \o/ Have [some WIPs]. <small>(I am a little sad about that inner eye area getting covered up because it's one of my favorite details but *oh well*.)</small> Used the same brush throughout & tried to make a point of not over-blending.
