(I'm also a fan of Mightyena and Hydreigon, but I felt like drawing Houndoom more.)<br>DRAGON: Best. Legendary. <i>Ever.</i> I like a lot of/ALL Dragon-types but Rayquaza takes the top.<br>ELECTRIC: Zebstrika is an excellent sweeper on my <i>Pokemon Black</i> game, and I just love its design.<br>FIGHTING: While not the prettiest Fighting-type, I don't really like Fighting-types <i>at all</i> based on appearance. I just drew Breloom because it's easiest to draw.<br>FIRE: <i>Charizard</i>. No explaining needed. (Also, I messed up on the chin, but eh.

Also, it looks like it's wearing shades. <i>Shades.</i><br>ICE: Articuno almost took this spot, but I've known about/liked Lapras for a much longer time.<br>NORMAL: I got Porygon as a result on a personality test and since then it's been a personal favorite. Herdier almost took its spot, but Porygon just has better Speed.<br>POISON: For reasons I don't feel like explaining, Seviper rules. Also, out of all the Pokemon I drew in this meme, I think it turned out the best.<br>PSYCHIC: Every time I play <i>FireRed</i>/<i>LeafGreen</i>, I always put a Kadabra on my team. And yes, that's a spoon, and it's supposed to look like it's being levitated via Kadabra's awesome powers.<br>ROCK: I swear, Onix is hard to draw... but either way, it looks cool.

However, I then stumbled upon some lovely free lineart by *NeonDragon (see below), and I decided "Eh, what the heck, I'll go for it."<br><br>It took a surprisingly long time to shade the fuzzy parts. Also, I made that Yin/Yang symbol in the background. It was a pain to figure out until I discovered the lazy person's trick: abuse of the circle tool.<br><br>Overall, though, I don't think it's awful so meh. I'm satisfied. <img title="La la la la" alt=":la:" height="19" width="19" src="https://e.deviantart.net/emoticons/l/la.gif"><br><br>Time Taken: I dunno, maybe about five hours at <i>least</i>...?

'Twas fun to do and if I have the time I'm definitely going to color it. (Syla's text color is a reference to what her dominant color is.

I forgot where I got her name from; I think it was mostly me throwing together a bunch of letters and seeing if I got anything good.<br><b>2:</b> I had lots of fun drawing this, especially the spaghetti-armed person-thing. (Syla, I get that you like to scare people, but <i>must</i> you use fire?)<br><b>3:</b> Because, y'know, the picture above didn't make that obvious. Syla's supposed to be darkened out like a silhouette over to the left there but I got lazy.<br><b>4:</b> This was quickly-drawn and is thus a rather boring section. It was basically made to show off more of Syla than just her head.<br><b>5:</b> Crappy rainbow is crappy. I drew this part when I was finishing the meme, which is why I got lazy and didn't include Syla.<br><b>6:</b> ...Yeah, I didn't really get this part, and neither did Syla.<br><b>7:</b> <a href="https://grouchoplz.deviantart.com/"><img title="Grouchoplz" alt=":icongrouchoplz:" src="https://a.deviantart.net/avatars/g/r/grouchoplz.jpg?1" class="avatar"></a><br><b>8:</b> THIS WAS SUCH A PAIN TO DRAW. The idea I had in mind was a half-jumping, half-backing up pose, but since my anatomy still sucks I completely failed. Oh well.

I'm not happy with this. I'm probably going to redo it. But you know what? I'm leaving in less than 24 hours and I have to post <i>something</i>.<br><strike>Screw shading.</strike></sub></sub></sub><br><br>This is Haley, aka She With An Unoriginal Design/Last Name. I was going to use her in my Crazy Dice Nuzlocke, but since I'm probably not gonna get to making that ever, might as well use 'er for the roleplay.<br><br>Basically, she's got no life and is addicted to gambling, so her mother gave her a Meowth (a super-belated birthday gift from when Haley was 10) and kicked her out of their apartment. I'll elaborate and all that crap when I redo this. |D<br><br><b>Rules</b><br>1) If your Pokémon faint, it's dead. Permabox. (Not release, because it conflicts with roll 20.)<br>2) Unless rolled otherwise, you catch the first Pokémon in each area. Shinys are no exceptions. Gifts and special Pokémon may be used. National Park counts as 2 areas, one normally and one Bug catching Contest. Safari Zone Pokémon may be caught twice: Once you first gain access and once you gain full access. Note that for both, you also need to repeat your roll.<br>3) You may only purchase 15 items per area.<br>4) HM slaves may be caught freely (given you have Pokéballs for it), but they don't count as teammates and may not be used in battle, even for fodder.<br>5) White Out = Game Over.<br>6) FOR EVERY NEW AREA YOU ENTER, ROLL A DIE WITH 20 SIDES. Depending on what you rolled, follow the list below:<br><br>1. Choose a random Team Member. That Team Member is now dead. Permabox ASAP. Invalid if current Team has only one member.<br>2. Choose a random Team Member. That Team member has to be boxed ASAP until the next Gym Leader has been defeated. You may pick the Pokémon up afterwards, if you wish so. This roll is incalid if your team contains only one member.<br>3. Swap out a random Team member with a random boxed Pokémon. Until the new Team Member dies, it is not allowed to leave the team, nor is the Pokémon left behind allowed to rejoin it. This roll is invalid if you have no boxed Pokémon.<br>4. Choose a random Team member. That Team member cannot ever evolve from its current form.<br>5. Choose a random Team member. That Team member is the only one that can be used on this area, either until said member is dead or you have finished all major events on it. This includes all trainers that are accessible the first visit, the Gym, and any sidequests right after.<br>6. This area, you can't choose to escape from random encounters, ever, or use repels.<br>7. This area, you can't fight wild Pokémon, can't attack/status or heal -- just mash Escape and don't do anything else. (Only exception: The first area catch.)<br>8. No catch this route. <br>9. You may catch 2 Pokémon this route.<br>10. You may try to catch your first 4 encounters, but you may not weaken or status them at all, but keep chucking balls at them.<br>11. You can't use the Pokémon Centre in this area, or the other free healing service.<br>12. You can't use healing items this area.<br>13. You may not purchase any items here.<br>14. You may only purchase 10 items here.<br>15. You may purchase 20 items here.<br>16. Choose a random Bag Section (Excluding TMs and Base items). Count the number of total items in that section. Use a die to roll a number in between 1 and that number. Chuck all items you have of that kind.<br>17. Throw away 5 items of your own choice.<br>18. Throw away 10 items of your own choice.<br>19. Nothing happens.<br>20. Revive 1 Pokémon! However, if you don't have any deaths (yet), you may not save this revive for later and this roll is invalid.<br><i>Stolen directly from <span class="username-with-symbol u"><a href="https://www.deviantart.com/wasserbienchen" class="u regular username">Wasserbienchen</a><span data-gruser-type="regular" data-show-tooltip="" data-quicktip-text="" class="user-symbol regular"></span></span> because I'm too lazy to type up everything in my own wording, &gt;:C As I said, I'm gonna redo this eventually....</i><br><br><div>Well.

This is going to be scrapped eventually.<br><br>See this? This is what happens when I'm on a plane for +12 hours/train for +10 hours/car for +[I didn't dare to count] days/etc. I make up my own absurd ideas to draw.<br><br><b>Translation</b> <i>for those who can't read my horrible handwriting; I try, I really do....</i><br><b><u>Note</u></b> I did a <i>lot</i> of sketching while on vacation; however, most drawings are of things I plan on redoing at some point in the future, so you <strike>suckas</strike> people don't get to see 'em... <i>yet</i>.<br>Oh, and for those who are wondering about why the last few drawings are lined, it's because I got extremely bored on the flight back and chose a few favorites to line.<br>Enough of my horrible handwriting. Read below for further <strike>rambling</strike> description!<br><br><b>Text Wall of Unnecessary Detail Below</b><br><u>Chinese Dragon-</u> I guess I'm fairly decent at drawing Asian-looking dragons, despite the fact I'm sure I forgot a lot of minor details... but I can <i>not</i> for the life of me draw in the style you see on all those old buildings or statues such as the ones in the Forbidden City. How people had the patience to draw such complicated dragons again and again blows my mind....<br><u>Giant Pandas-</u> When I visited the panda breeding center in Chengdu, a few of the pandas were sitting in a much more reclined position than I've shown, with piles of bamboo on their laps. They really don't do much more than lie down, eat, and occasionally walk around from what I got to see. Also, the muzzles look like dog or wolf snouts; I swear the original looked better....<br><u>"HERE'S DRAKO"-</u> Around this time I started suffering from a crack withdrawal. So I made my own. Mind you, I didn't have a reference (other than my cruddy memory) for any of these drawings, so it doesn't quite look like a Hydreigon... but eh, it was strangely easier than drawing a creepy Ditto. Not much you can do with two dots and a line....<br><u>Some Kind of Raptor-</u> Not the dinosaur kind, obviously. On the Guilin Li River Cruise, I saw a couple of big birds like hawks or eagles or something fishing around a certain area like crazy.<br><u>Catchin' Flies-</u> Also on the Li River Cruise, there was some guy sitting across the aisle from me (more info on the setup later) who slept the whole time. His snoring was ridiculously loud and his mouth was wide open. <strike>No need to tell me how horrible the anatomy is on this. I'm well aware there's mistakes everywhere.</strike><br><u>Attempt at Japanese Style-</u> ...I honestly have no idea when I drew this thing and the rest of the drawings. At any rate, I got extremely bored and ended up drawing an angry cartoonish cat....<br><u>The Many Faces of Derppaw-</u> Thus, I was inspired to doodle an old character of mine, Derppaw. I think he's from an old roleplay or something. For all I can say, I <i>love</i> drawing impossible expressions.<br><u>"Canon" Zubat-</u> As mentioned before, my mind was my only reference when I drew these; as such, I had a vague idea of what a Zubat actually looks like so I decided to draw it twice: once in its "canon" form, and another as I thought looked better. Unfortunately I ended up spilling some drink on my redesigned version, because the pencil lead's all blurry now. :C<br><u>Underbite Zubat (no title shown)-</u> Just a preview of a character who may or may not show up at some point in that comic I've been planning out. If he does end up making an appearance, well... Zubats have no eyes, but gain two when they evolve; what would happen to a Zubat who already has eyes?<br><br>Finally, to those who are actually interested: I'm currently in the process of typing up that promised tl;dr journal documenting the trip.</div>

No, it's probably not something that would interest people looking for the kind of story that will keep you on the edge of your seat; it's more of a memoir than novel.

Because it's not like I've been thinking about posting something like this for ages...! 8'D<br><br>Speaks for itself, I think. I'm not exaggerating when I say that a majority of my Human Anatomy Improvement (arguably 90%, though I <i>did</i> take a figure drawing class last semester) is thanks to pokemon people. Thanks, player characters, for being blank slates just waiting for me to impose countless notebooks' worth of headcanon upon, to the point where I honestly don't know whether to call half these people fan or original characters. (The distinction is trivial as far as I'm concerned, but that's another ramble for another time. The point is that I could translate a majority of these people into a not-pokemon world and for the most part their characters would still work.) C:&lt;<br><br><sub>You may or may not recognize Shauna, whose canon hair I tried drawing a grand total of once before saying "fuck it."

    <div class="legacy-journal _2DahR _3bG54 _3if5g">So about three years ago I watched this awesome "anime" (which is in air quotes because if you pick an anime trope, any anime trope, it is probably not present in this one), Naoki Urasawa's <i>Monster</i>, and to date it is one of the most fantastic things I've ever watched. At the time I was decidedly not confident in my human faces or anatomy or anything, unfortunately, so I was quietly resigned to not drawing any fanart.<br><br>Fast-forward to the present and as of yesterday I got a friend into it, prompting me to revisit some of my favorite parts, and then it hit me: I am actually fairly confident in my people-drawing skills now! You can see what that led to. &gt;8D<br><br>Seriously, if you want a psychological drama full of ethical dilemmas, character depth (even for the one-scene wonders!), and a surprising amount of optimism considering the gritty backdrop, I highly recommend <i>Monster</i>.

    <div class="legacy-journal _2DahR _3bG54 _3if5g">Even before the hiatus, I've been wanting to draw some full-body references for some of <i><a href="https://nightauctor.deviantart.com/gallery/59137803/The-Firebird-Effect?offset=48">The Firebird Effect</a></i>'s characters. Countless weeks later, my internet gave me the Christmas gift of going to complete and utter hell for &gt;2 days straight, but at least it was enough of a kick to hyperfocus &amp; finish all of these on the 24th. &gt;8V<br><br>Things To Note:<br>* These were drawn as standalones and are ordered by first appearance, so any places where characters seem to be looking at each other are entirely coincidental. (Yes, I know this makes it look like Kojo is smiling at Shauna. It makes more sense if he's to the far left but that would've messed up the whole "chronological by introduction" thing. Don't read into it. OTL)<br>* Heights are relative. I have my "headcanons" but for all intents and purposes the exact numbers are up to the imagination. I just like having something a bit more specific than "X is taller than Y is shorter than Z" etc.<br>* Palettes are "default" and thus unlikely to be used to the exact hex code in-comic, because I like playing with color schemes and refuse to do the lazy low-opacity layer mode thing <strike>that I used in the first scene</strike> ever again.<br>* But wait, there's more! Expect updates as more characters are introduced. ;y<br><br><sub>yells softly about what category this even goes in</sub><br><br>-<br>2/11/17 - Made a few tweaks to Alec &amp; Serena.</div>

    <div class="legacy-journal _2DahR _3bG54 _3if5g">Because I always post stuff like this to tumblr but it felt more relevant to dA for various reasons.<br><br>DESCRIPTION DUMP AHOY.<br><br><b>row 1</b> - A couple "speedpaints" because I really need too loosen up more in the painting department. Didn't time either but tried to limit the time taken. First is a blue dacnis, referenced from <a href="https://www.deviantart.com/users/outgoing?https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:Dacnis_cayana.jpg" class="external">this photo on Wikimedia Commons</a>, and second is the photo <a href="https://www.deviantart.com/users/outgoing?https://www.flickr.com/photos/thelotuscarroll/9195268459/" class="external">"Haunted In One Way Or Another" on flickr</a>. I found both image links buried in my bookmarks yesterday (5/20, it's passing midnight as I type this description) for no apparent reason but I probably wanted to do a color study or something so ~ta-da~<br><b>rows 2-8</b> - Front views of dragons on Flight Rising, which I don't think I've mentioned here before but it's basically dragon neopets and I love it. (Psst, if you join, refer <a href="https://www.deviantart.com/users/outgoing?http://flightrising.com/main.php?p=lair&amp;tab=userpage&amp;id=138250" class="external">Archaeoraptor</a> and I will toss you 100 food point.) These have also been posted on <a href="https://www.deviantart.com/users/outgoing?http://archaeoraptor.tumblr.com/post/160933940899/" class="external">my FR blog</a>, if you wanna check that out; as always, there are more scribbles lying around my blog that dA will probably never see. ;V<br><b>row 9</b> - And thus begins a saga that started around afternoon today when I went digging through google drive for a <a href="https://nightauctor.deviantart.com/gallery/59137803/The-Firebird-Effect"><i>TFE</i></a> tidbit and found an unzipped backup of art from my old computer. That dratini was my first tumblr icon and I thiiink I might've used it on the Nuzlocke Forums...? I was totally forgetting I have an account there, whoops. Furry on the right was one of my earliest attempts at anthro anatomy and, well. I hadn't practiced humans back then whatsoever never mind blending 'em with canines. :I I'm still not used to combining those weird limb structures, honestly, but I'd like to think I'm better than I was in... 2011? 2012? Yeah. Old stuff.<br><b>row 10</b> - Zero blep? Zero blep. Because after all these years I still remember how to draw that lizard, more or less. Red wolf on the right begins a little saga I call "shout-out to younger me and my shameless sparklewolves" - I spent a majority of my internet time pre-dA on assorted roleplay forums, yes. "Raizel" here was one of many short-lived characters who I wouldn't have remembered if not for the <strike>terrible</strike> icon edit just sitting in my files, and I know for a fact the original photo was stock of some sort but I can't for the life of me track it down again. &gt;:T<br><b>row 11</b> - If not a roleplay forum I could probably be found on a pet sim. I got the two technicolor disasters on the left from Furry Paws; I forget if I spent actual virtual money on Alex and Charlie's designs but, seeing as I did literally nothing with them beyond saving the reference pictures, hopefully not. Meanwhile, significantly less technicolor wolf on the right is Auto Silouitt, yet another aforementioned short-lived character. He seems like a grumpy old fart though and it took me until today to realize the surname is probably a play on <i>silhouette</i>. ~The More You Know~<br><b>row 12</b> - More random designs? More random designs! I'm honestly not sure if Jinx and Ranger were roleplay characters, but the dramatically lit maned wolf was actually featured in one of my first deviations. <a href="http://fav.me/d46tosd">Behold.</a> (In other news, is it just me or do digital artists tend to go from aggressively watermarking everything to not really caring about signatures/watermarks to, if they get popular enough, <i>needing</i> to watermark everything as theft prevention? Funny how that works.)<br><b>row 13</b> - Last but certainly not least, my good ol' half-namesake Slade Auctor! looking grumpier than usual and now with eyes that don't seem to be slapped onto the face as an afterthought. And then there's a design that would probably be deemed an "edgy nightmare," especially with colors, but y'know what? You wanna know what this whole revisiting old characters thing is like a gift to my younger self, and while I was definitely influenced by the anti-wolfaboo crowd (as nothing more than a lurker, shh), I think I did alright, bloody chained dragon-hellhounds and all. (Yes, his name really was <i>Massacre</i>. No, I really can't drudge up a single memory of doing anything with him, not even making the reference in that one wolf maker sparkledog-loving youth love.)<br><br>So, yeah. Art! \o/</div>

    <div class="legacy-journal _2DahR _3bG54 _3if5g">So who here remembers the thing where I kinda unintentionally started a little annual tradition of redrawing a buncha people from an old anatomy practice sketchdump? <a href="http://fav.me/d6kwmja">It's</a> <a href="http://fav.me/d7rde3m">been</a> <a href="http://fav.me/d8x5v27">four</a> <a href="http://fav.me/da6eb88">years</a>. (Each of those words is a different link.) <i>How.</i><br><br>Anywho, decided to go "back to basics" for this one ft. a really cool technique-thingo(?? I have no idea what to call it) I learned in class this semester! Doodled some quick gestures while zoomed out to get the overall layout down (hence the faded pixel sketches), then just went in at 100% zoom on one layer. Took <i>much</i> less time than the past couple years' "sketch it all separate then fuck around in GIMP to put it together" method and probably maybe looks better. :Y<br>Also scrapped the whole "these are Specific Characters" thing and went with generic mostly-faceless people. You can kiiinda make out the occasional individual face shape but for the most part I figured drawing Actual Characters wasn't necessary. And/or I was lazy. :I<br><br>In any case, definitely wasn't too concerned with getting the proportions perfect here, which... definitely defeats the point of an <i>anatomy practice</i> sketchdump but oh well that's why I take figure drawing classes. (The fencing lunge is the only one I used a reference for, which I can't link because by "used a reference" I mean "stared at the google image search results page a little.") Gestures, man! Gestures are important!! And not that I'm some kinda anatomy expert, but I'm confident enough in it that my priority nowadays is movement.<br><br>Except the hand. Random giant hand will be random giant hand forever.<br><br>GIANT RAMBLEDUMP ASIDE you know the drill on constructive criticism, yeah? Yeah. Stagnation is bad, inks are scary, human anatomy is a witch.<br><br>...I'm mildly overtired \o/</div>

    <div class="legacy-journal _2DahR _3bG54 _3if5g">Been wanting to upload an expression practice dump and then slapped on some weird lighting because why not \o/ Mostly avoided 100% zoom to avoid getting too perfectionistic, and palettes chosen manually because fuck layer modes that's why. (As a side note, that's why if anything looks screwy in the color department, I take full blame.)<br><br>Obviously not the most cleaned-up thing I've ever uploaded but hey.

    <div class="legacy-journal _2DahR _3bG54 _3if5g"><div>Plot twist: I do animation sometimes \o/ I basically never post it (anywhere, and definitely haven’t on dA), but I got the urge to actually Finish One today (or at least try) and at <span class="username-with-symbol u"><a href="https://www.deviantart.com/starmoths" class="u regular username">starmoths</a><span data-gruser-type="regular" data-show-tooltip="" data-quicktip-text="" class="user-symbol regular"></span></span>’* suggestion it’s a woof. Specifically a Finley, an RP character of mine who popped up in <a href="https://www.deviantart.com/nightauctor/art/doge-dump-850548284">these</a> two <a href="https://www.deviantart.com/nightauctor/art/doge-dump-2-853897493">sketchdumps</a>; I’m not using her for writing anymore but she makes a good guinea pig. We are totally going to ignore that I got her muzzle marking wrong, shhh.</div><div><br></div><div>Anyway, I <em>gotta</em> finish this tomorrow, but (as with all my deviations) <b>critique is very welcome</b> whether you’re an animation nerd or not! I’m not sure how much I’ll be changing other than adding color (might add a blink or mouth movement at the end or something; heck if I remember what shred of context I started out with) but I’ve been staring at &amp; rewatching this too much to know if it’s too fast or what.</div><div><br></div><div>More artist notes because I can: Wolf realism is not my strong suit and thus the blocky/angular style happened. I’m not thrilled with the eyes being ovals when everything else is Not That, but (as you can probably see from the blinks) that’s mostly just to make sure the dot eyes don’t look too “floaty;” we’ll see how that translates in color. Speaking of eyes, the eyebrow movement at the end got thrown off by leaving the sketch layer on, but <em>oh well</em> consider that an early preview; I’ll probably upload a video of The Process when this is all done. And anyway, context be damned, this checks the “expression change animation” box I wanted to tick off today, and I didn’t even have to cry over clothing or hair or human face angles or anything ᕕ( ᐛ )ᕗ<br></div><div><br></div><div><br></div><div>*edit: SORRY DEVIANTART USER HAWKMOTH FOR THE RANDOM NOTIFICATION IF YOU GOT IT.

    <div class="legacy-journal _2DahR _3bG54 _3if5g"><div>I mentioned <a href="https://www.deviantart.com/a-flyleaf/art/sketchdump-roundup-04-2021-Long-Mode-878015249">last month</a> that I got Krita and it has nice brushes. This month has been FOCUS PING-PONG but in the midst of it all, figured I’d put some of those brushes to use through little speedpaints, since it’s been ages since I last did a proper (as in not ~650x500) digital painting from a photo reference. Ultimately I ended up using like… two brushes, predominantly, but <em>ayy</em> gotta love colors :y</div><div><br></div><div>Unofficial self-imposed guidelines: no preset palettes (so all the colors were picked by eye or already on the canvas, not directly from the reference <em>or</em> a set swatch), was mostly zoomed at 50% or less (mostly so I could fit both it and the reference onscreen simultaneously, but also for the sake of this next point), and <em>no perfectionism allowed</em>. I don’t do digital painting a lot because I get lost in the details and usually end up not liking it after hours of rendering, so (barring that dream outlier) this was a little attempt to stretch the comfort zone and whatnot.</div><div><br></div><div>But yeah, wanted to post these separately since the file size is pretty big; not sure if speedpaint-dumps will become a regular thing (or maybe I’ll start posting them separately if I like ’em enough?), but here ya go~<br></div><br><div>Obligatory sources (and context):<ul><li><a href="https://www.deviantart.com/users/outgoing?https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:Hairy_Woodpecker_(8468754362).jpg" class="external">hairy woodpecker</a> (saw one at a birdfeeder, very cool)</li><li><a href="https://www.deviantart.com/users/outgoing?https://soundcloud.com/interval-audio/arcrux-guillotine" class="external">Arcrux - Guillotine</a> (is a song, found it forever ago via <a href="https://www.deviantart.com/users/outgoing?https://sounddesignerjeans.tumblr.com/post/186098593528/sounddesignerjeans-sounddesignerjeans" class="external">this post</a>)</li><li><a href="https://www.deviantart.com/users/outgoing?https://www.gettyimages.com/detail/photo/bridger-teton-national-forest-at-sunrise-wyoming-royalty-free-image/594833583" class="external">Bridger-Teton National Forest</a> (randomized Windows lockscreen 1/2)</li><li><a href="https://www.deviantart.com/users/outgoing?https://www.shutterstock.com/image-photo/laguna-colorada-on-eduardo-avaroa-national-1344463298" class="external">Laguna Colorada</a> (randomized Windows lockscreen 2/2)</li><li><a href="https://www.deviantart.com/users/outgoing?https://www.flickr.com/photos/127379026@N05/37834169725" class="external">aardwolf</a> (think it was in a post somewhere but I forgot to bookmark it, F)</li></ul></div><div><br></div><div>Did some other photo-reference-paintings this month but not on big canvases, sooo look forward to those whenever I get around to the obligatory <a href="https://www.deviantart.com/a-flyleaf/gallery?q=%23roundup">monthly roundup</a>!

    <div class="legacy-journal _2DahR _3bG54 _3if5g"><div>The first time I alluded to the characters from this thing actually being Called Something it was <a href="https://www.deviantart.com/a-flyleaf/art/sketchdump-03-2021-no-alignment-speedrun-874931330">this guy</a> and he was still going by the placeholder moniker “Jock.” It’s only fair he gets to be the first to have an Actual Name Reveal.</div><div><br></div><div>ANYWAY. OK. SO.</div><div><br></div><div>This is basically another “comic test,” in the vein of <a href="https://www.deviantart.com/a-flyleaf/art/hello-reddit-i-have-jaundice-890815714">this one</a> except it features an actual shitpost-free scene. Presenting things in chronological order is for Dedicated Projects, a thing which this is still technically not, but I’m having fun messing around with it writing- and art-wise anyway.</div><div><br></div><div>THAT SAID there were sorrrta some conflicting priorities here. There was going to be an attempt at crowd shots but then I realized it looked weird with the way I was lining it so it became Mass of Blob. (I mean, pov character is not paying attention to any of those randos, but it’s still vaguer in the first couple panels than I would’ve liked.) I knew from the getgo I wasn’t going to color the characters cleanly like ^the other linked test, but I’m still not 100% sure about having them all solid like this. Probably my main gripe with how this turned out is that it’s kinda muddy, not just in a color scheme way. Maaaybe instead of doing a line → color pipeline, I’ll try something like sketch &amp; dialogue → block in values/colors → <em>then</em> lines, clarifying details where needed and leaving the rest to value?<br></div><div><br></div><div>Oh, and then there’s, uh, -gestures towards middle right- That One Bit. Theoretically it makes sense in the context of the full story, although I’m not sure how I’d want to handle that aspect visually. For now have <a href="https://sta.sh/01kfy59695rx">this</a> (which waaaaas done <em>after</em> the big panels, and it kinda shows because I was completely winging it on the page).<br></div><div><br></div><div>Anyway, the dialogue stuff (abstract speech bubbles + character “fonts”) is the most successful experiment here, imo. Everything else, take it or leave it. Definitely did <em>not</em> expedite the process in any way. Having said all that, I’ve been thinking I should do more experiments not just with standalone doodles but with Whole-Ass Sequential Art™, since doing a cool effect or varying art style for the shits is a <em>whole</em> different ballpark than doing a cool effect or varying art style for Storytelling™. Inevitably it will take a long-ass time, but maybe with ample experimentation it will eventually take a less-ass time, and also still look cool.<br></div><div><br></div><div>TL;DR Experiment Failed (semi-)Successfully… 2!!</div><div><br></div><div><br></div><div>Time taken: ~5h35m, over the past 3 days<br></div></div>

And with my own dang “template,” as a compromise between coding yet another Entire Thing (got that out of my system with <a href="https://www.deviantart.com/users/outgoing?https://a-flyleaf.github.io/shriblets/2021-12-28-tenyears/" class="external">the 10-year showoff</a>, for now) and sticking with one piece per month. Text sizes are based vaguely on both how many deviations I uploaded each month (October in the lead at 11, February/June/August tied for least at 4), and yes I know October/November are in the wrong order. Next year maybe I’ll buck the chronology entirely for maximum size consistency, but for now I just wanted to get this out &amp; done ᕕ( ᐛ )ᕗ<br></div><div><br></div><div>Since I typically follow up on the previous year’s notes, even though I’ve been more active here lately and so most of this probably isn’t new:</div><div><ul><li>Project status, project status… gestures towards <a href="https://www.deviantart.com/a-flyleaf/journal/Hi-I-wrote-a-blog-post-901563419">this</a> and yeets</li><li>I am not sure I’ve gotten better at backgrounds-as-in-scenery, but I’ve <em>definitely</em> been using more backgrounds-as-in-color-or-pattern; <a href="https://www.deviantart.com/middynos">Middynos</a> specifically has been a big inspiration on that front ;V</li><li>Fell in love with the square brush during ArtFight in July, have used it <em>a lot</em> since.

I dunno, can’t say shit in this economy considering how 2020 went, but I’ll see how it plays out. Also, I’ve linked <a href="https://www.deviantart.com/users/outgoing?https://www.oliverburkeman.com/books" class="external">this book</a> before (<i>Four-Thousand Weeks</i>, in case the page changes), but I’m doing it again because it has seriously not left my mind.

OKAY.</div><div><br></div><div>While I am still not 100% sure how to present ~the Actual Canonical Story~, I <em>did</em> want to actually draw out a scene from it. Specifically this one, because it’s 1) one of the earliest, and so kiiiind of works as a standalone (though I thought the preceding context was important enough to throw in anyway, even if it’s tonally dissonant as presented), and 2) the general first part has barely changed since the story’s inception. (You might recognize the major beats from <a href="https://www.deviantart.com/a-flyleaf/art/sketchdump-02-2021-is-this-a-character-developmen-871817795">February last year</a>, setting and character design tweaks notwithstanding ;V)<br></div><div><br></div><div>There is one caveat to the “canonicity” of this, and it’s that the food can be… basically anything, really?

Then the rollercoaster took a sharp turn downwards this past week, between -gestures vaguely at world- and death in the family.

As with last year’s, it probably actually looks better at thumbnail size/from a distance since you can actually make out the month abbreviations then, but I spent too long calculating upload counts and pixel-arting the text to Not use it &gt;:V Colors are kinda muted compared to last year, though on the whole I don’t think there’s been much difference. Also, as per usual, I went back and forth on a bunch of months to the point where choices were made based almost more on compositional neatness than whether the piece was actually My Favorite™ (haha jk I can never pick just one).</div><div><br></div><div>Also, can I just say there was an absurd amount of compilation-esque art here (multiple smaller drawings on one canvas), not even including the roundups?? Some of it’s a byproduct of, say, not wanting to upload commissions separately, but there’s also a good amount of canvases where I planned that from the getgo. Neat and fun (and also a good way to make backgrounds interesting without scenery) &gt;:0<ul><li>Far as ~project~ stuff is concerned, I’ve spent the last ~4 months and counting (started writing in September, page-coding and drawing in October onward) working on <a href="https://www.deviantart.com/users/outgoing?https://a-flyleaf.github.io/ygbtdm/au/" class="external">an AU for my “main story,”</a>, and it’s taught me a lot that I can and probably will write a whole blog post about. well, when it’s like, Done™. And until then I’m just gonna say that I’ve had the actual canonical main story more or less finished for months now, give or take some scene-level details, and you’ll see <em>something</em> of it sooner or later ¯\_(ツ)_/¯</li><li>So, yeah, have not practiced scenery for beans but that’s where transparency and patterns and other compositional screwery comes in. Certainly wouldn’t <em>hurt</em> to practice more but TBQH half the time I’d rather let the details fall into impressionistic abstraction anyway, so, shrug?</li><li>Very, <em>very</em> happy that aforementioned AU has finally let me put that style-as-narrative sort of thing into practice; partially unintentional (it was more painterly until I realized that was taking <em>way</em> too long), but I <em>love</em> excuses to whip out the scribbly chaos. Brush-wise, still love the square brush, and always messing with sketchier-looking textures.</li><li>Keeping up with comments/people/General Communications continues to be a self-impoesd all-or-nothing rollercoaster. I’ve been getting out more irl lately and we’ll see how that affects The Internet Activity—but dw, I basically grew up in/on the general hellhole that is The Interwebs, I can almost definitely never leave y’all for good ;V</li><li>I don’t think I’ve gotten into any new media this year?? This is somewhat voluntary (always have this lingering feeling that I Could Be Doing Something Else), and of course there’s always my own &amp; friends’ stuff to nerd out over, but branching out a bit probably wouldn’t be <em>awful</em>.</li></ul>I feel like “[doing something different] wouldn’t be Terrible, actually” is basically an ongoing theme of, if not the whole year, these last few months? I graduated For Good in the spring, what the fuck, and recently I’ve caught myself thinking of like, 19-year-olds as young. You know, when I gave my current protag a quarter-life-crisis, it wasn’t supposed to Actually Apply To Me several months later!! &gt;:V Cons of writing people roughly in and/or slightly older than your own age range etc.</div><div><br>Far as general year-in-review rambling is concerned, that’s probably best saved for aforementioned hypothetical future blog post. But to follow up on some thoughts from last year: consequences/culmination of $stuff is pretty much behind me at this point, which is bittersweet, as vaguely-negative $stuff tends to be. This holiday season was actually pretty decent, in that I actually did spend it with friends both online and off; last year, iirc, the whole season passed like normal-ass days, except everyone was stressed as usual and it felt shitty because You’re Not Supposed To Feel Bad At This Time Of Year. And like, it’s not like the latter half of this year <em>hasn’t</em> been somber; two grandparents and my dog passed away within the year, so, that’s. sad.</div><div><br></div><div>…Damn, there really isn’t a good way to continue from that, is there? Uh, having hung this lampshade—2022 did not feel like a refresher/reset/rejuvenation <em>at all</em>, but as life do, the bad stuff was interlaced with some eye-opening experiences, for worse <em>and</em> for better. You know, it’s one thing to talk about how great friends are and how important it is to push the comfort zone, self-introspection and breaking/replacing unhealthy habits and all that jazz, but it’s another to, y’know… <em>do</em> all that. I’ve written a few stream-of-consciousness blog posts throughout the year that I haven’t been itching to advertise because I don’t think they’re particularly comprehensible to anyone who isn’t me, but that’s… fine, tbh. They don’t have to be.</div><div><br></div><div>I don’t know, I’ve never been particularly personal in these descriptions. I keep typing things and then backspacing furiously because That’s Blog Post Material, Save It. But like, I think artistically I haven’t made any particular major jumps, and normally/previously I might beat myself up about that a little but like: who cares. It makes me fucking sad to see people putting themselves down because they’re not painting level+100 masterpieces every day. I’m increasingly… <em>allergic</em> isn’t the right word, but like, cringe and irony and detachment and all that? where someone does something they’re clearly loving but preface it with a thousand semi-joking self-deprecating disclaimers to ward off external judgment before anyone else can lift a finger? I empathize, and that’s why it makes my skin crawl.

I <em>think</em> I’m finally crawling out of the artblock abyss, but earlier in the month I was like “hey, if all I feel like is drawing headshots, isn’t that a good excuse to do <a href="https://www.deviantart.com/users/outgoing?https://web.archive.org/web/20230711155453/https://nitter.net/heyitspegkat/status/1638785959452897282" class="external">that one ‘the cast in your style’ meme</a> that I’ve been eyeing for months.” So here are the people I’ve been drawing copious amounts of for like 8 months now, except all together in full color \o/<br></div><div><br></div><div>Copypasting part of the description from <a href="https://www.deviantart.com/users/outgoing?https://a-flyleaf.github.io/omori/art/headshots" class="external">my site</a> (though as usual, it’s extended over there):</div><div>-<br></div><div>Didn’t use the actual template for a couple reasons; firstly because I have no idea who made it (the version linked above doesn’t seem to be the original; there are faint traces of someone else’s art on it), and moreover because, as per <a href="https://www.deviantart.com/users/outgoing?https://www.omori-game.com/en/updates" class="external">the fanwork policy</a>, I try not to use official assets anywhere. Also, thought it’d be cool to do a sort of style comparison, one which draws (har har) more from the game canon and the other with more of my own liberties.<br><br>Incidentally I figure the Headspace crew looks more or less exactly as presented in-game, so! Twofold comparison combo &gt;:3c<br><br>Pencil-esque coloring style on the real-world took forever but was surprisingly fun! Relatively flat shading was ?inspired by (feels like the wrong word, nothing was directly referenced, but these styles were In Mind at the time) the official talksprites + <a href="https://www.deviantart.com/users/outgoing?https://web.archive.org/web/20230711154528/https://nitter.net/pic/orig/media%2FFWj7cDDVsAEVU4l.jpg" class="external">Faraway fullbodies</a>, as well as various art by @udtcue (on <a href="https://www.deviantart.com/users/outgoing?https://www.tumblr.com/udtcue/" class="external">Tumblr</a> + <a href="https://www.deviantart.com/users/outgoing?https://nitter.net/udtcue" class="external">(not-)Twitter</a>).</div><div><br></div><div>Time taken: 7h30m, most of which was probably all that pencil-style coloring. Turns out scribbling like that is relaxing, even if it kills my hand a little \o"/<br></div><div>-</div><div>As a side note I do not use default palettes for any of them, so skintones and such vary wildly across scribbles. The official art isn’t consistent either, though (relative value ftw), so ¯\_(ツ)_/¯<br></div></div>

I actually still have his original adoptable pixel-ref saved, buried in the layers of that file! It’s not public because I haven’t asked the original artist if they’re cool with that, but colors and base markings in that old ref did not change whatsoever. <i>Copious</i> amounts of liberties taken since, and will continue to be with reckless abandon 🥳<br></div></div>
