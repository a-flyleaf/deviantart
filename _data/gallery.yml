(I'm also a fan of Mightyena and Hydreigon, but I felt like drawing Houndoom more.)<br>DRAGON: Best. Legendary. <i>Ever.</i> I like a lot of/ALL Dragon-types but Rayquaza takes the top.<br>ELECTRIC: Zebstrika is an excellent sweeper on my <i>Pokemon Black</i> game, and I just love its design.<br>FIGHTING: While not the prettiest Fighting-type, I don't really like Fighting-types <i>at all</i> based on appearance. I just drew Breloom because it's easiest to draw.<br>FIRE: <i>Charizard</i>. No explaining needed. (Also, I messed up on the chin, but eh.

Also, it looks like it's wearing shades. <i>Shades.</i><br>ICE: Articuno almost took this spot, but I've known about/liked Lapras for a much longer time.<br>NORMAL: I got Porygon as a result on a personality test and since then it's been a personal favorite. Herdier almost took its spot, but Porygon just has better Speed.<br>POISON: For reasons I don't feel like explaining, Seviper rules. Also, out of all the Pokemon I drew in this meme, I think it turned out the best.<br>PSYCHIC: Every time I play <i>FireRed</i>/<i>LeafGreen</i>, I always put a Kadabra on my team. And yes, that's a spoon, and it's supposed to look like it's being levitated via Kadabra's awesome powers.<br>ROCK: I swear, Onix is hard to draw... but either way, it looks cool.

However, I then stumbled upon some lovely free lineart by *NeonDragon (see below), and I decided "Eh, what the heck, I'll go for it."<br><br>It took a surprisingly long time to shade the fuzzy parts. Also, I made that Yin/Yang symbol in the background. It was a pain to figure out until I discovered the lazy person's trick: abuse of the circle tool.<br><br>Overall, though, I don't think it's awful so meh. I'm satisfied. <img title="La la la la" alt=":la:" height="19" width="19" src="https://e.deviantart.net/emoticons/l/la.gif"><br><br>Time Taken: I dunno, maybe about five hours at <i>least</i>...?

'Twas fun to do and if I have the time I'm definitely going to color it. (Syla's text color is a reference to what her dominant color is.

I forgot where I got her name from; I think it was mostly me throwing together a bunch of letters and seeing if I got anything good.<br><b>2:</b> I had lots of fun drawing this, especially the spaghetti-armed person-thing. (Syla, I get that you like to scare people, but <i>must</i> you use fire?)<br><b>3:</b> Because, y'know, the picture above didn't make that obvious. Syla's supposed to be darkened out like a silhouette over to the left there but I got lazy.<br><b>4:</b> This was quickly-drawn and is thus a rather boring section. It was basically made to show off more of Syla than just her head.<br><b>5:</b> Crappy rainbow is crappy. I drew this part when I was finishing the meme, which is why I got lazy and didn't include Syla.<br><b>6:</b> ...Yeah, I didn't really get this part, and neither did Syla.<br><b>7:</b> <a href="https://grouchoplz.deviantart.com/"><img title="Grouchoplz" alt=":icongrouchoplz:" src="https://a.deviantart.net/avatars/g/r/grouchoplz.jpg?1" class="avatar"></a><br><b>8:</b> THIS WAS SUCH A PAIN TO DRAW. The idea I had in mind was a half-jumping, half-backing up pose, but since my anatomy still sucks I completely failed. Oh well.

I'm not happy with this. I'm probably going to redo it. But you know what? I'm leaving in less than 24 hours and I have to post <i>something</i>.<br><strike>Screw shading.</strike></sub></sub></sub><br><br>This is Haley, aka She With An Unoriginal Design/Last Name. I was going to use her in my Crazy Dice Nuzlocke, but since I'm probably not gonna get to making that ever, might as well use 'er for the roleplay.<br><br>Basically, she's got no life and is addicted to gambling, so her mother gave her a Meowth (a super-belated birthday gift from when Haley was 10) and kicked her out of their apartment. I'll elaborate and all that crap when I redo this. |D<br><br><b>Rules</b><br>1) If your Pokémon faint, it's dead. Permabox. (Not release, because it conflicts with roll 20.)<br>2) Unless rolled otherwise, you catch the first Pokémon in each area. Shinys are no exceptions. Gifts and special Pokémon may be used. National Park counts as 2 areas, one normally and one Bug catching Contest. Safari Zone Pokémon may be caught twice: Once you first gain access and once you gain full access. Note that for both, you also need to repeat your roll.<br>3) You may only purchase 15 items per area.<br>4) HM slaves may be caught freely (given you have Pokéballs for it), but they don't count as teammates and may not be used in battle, even for fodder.<br>5) White Out = Game Over.<br>6) FOR EVERY NEW AREA YOU ENTER, ROLL A DIE WITH 20 SIDES. Depending on what you rolled, follow the list below:<br><br>1. Choose a random Team Member. That Team Member is now dead. Permabox ASAP. Invalid if current Team has only one member.<br>2. Choose a random Team Member. That Team member has to be boxed ASAP until the next Gym Leader has been defeated. You may pick the Pokémon up afterwards, if you wish so. This roll is incalid if your team contains only one member.<br>3. Swap out a random Team member with a random boxed Pokémon. Until the new Team Member dies, it is not allowed to leave the team, nor is the Pokémon left behind allowed to rejoin it. This roll is invalid if you have no boxed Pokémon.<br>4. Choose a random Team member. That Team member cannot ever evolve from its current form.<br>5. Choose a random Team member. That Team member is the only one that can be used on this area, either until said member is dead or you have finished all major events on it. This includes all trainers that are accessible the first visit, the Gym, and any sidequests right after.<br>6. This area, you can't choose to escape from random encounters, ever, or use repels.<br>7. This area, you can't fight wild Pokémon, can't attack/status or heal -- just mash Escape and don't do anything else. (Only exception: The first area catch.)<br>8. No catch this route. <br>9. You may catch 2 Pokémon this route.<br>10. You may try to catch your first 4 encounters, but you may not weaken or status them at all, but keep chucking balls at them.<br>11. You can't use the Pokémon Centre in this area, or the other free healing service.<br>12. You can't use healing items this area.<br>13. You may not purchase any items here.<br>14. You may only purchase 10 items here.<br>15. You may purchase 20 items here.<br>16. Choose a random Bag Section (Excluding TMs and Base items). Count the number of total items in that section. Use a die to roll a number in between 1 and that number. Chuck all items you have of that kind.<br>17. Throw away 5 items of your own choice.<br>18. Throw away 10 items of your own choice.<br>19. Nothing happens.<br>20. Revive 1 Pokémon! However, if you don't have any deaths (yet), you may not save this revive for later and this roll is invalid.<br><i>Stolen directly from <span class="username-with-symbol u"><a href="https://www.deviantart.com/wasserbienchen" class="u regular username">Wasserbienchen</a><span data-gruser-type="regular" data-show-tooltip="" data-quicktip-text="" class="user-symbol regular"></span></span> because I'm too lazy to type up everything in my own wording, &gt;:C As I said, I'm gonna redo this eventually....</i><br><br><div>Well.

This is going to be scrapped eventually.<br><br>See this? This is what happens when I'm on a plane for +12 hours/train for +10 hours/car for +[I didn't dare to count] days/etc. I make up my own absurd ideas to draw.<br><br><b>Translation</b> <i>for those who can't read my horrible handwriting; I try, I really do....</i><br><b><u>Note</u></b> I did a <i>lot</i> of sketching while on vacation; however, most drawings are of things I plan on redoing at some point in the future, so you <strike>suckas</strike> people don't get to see 'em... <i>yet</i>.<br>Oh, and for those who are wondering about why the last few drawings are lined, it's because I got extremely bored on the flight back and chose a few favorites to line.<br>Enough of my horrible handwriting. Read below for further <strike>rambling</strike> description!<br><br><b>Text Wall of Unnecessary Detail Below</b><br><u>Chinese Dragon-</u> I guess I'm fairly decent at drawing Asian-looking dragons, despite the fact I'm sure I forgot a lot of minor details... but I can <i>not</i> for the life of me draw in the style you see on all those old buildings or statues such as the ones in the Forbidden City. How people had the patience to draw such complicated dragons again and again blows my mind....<br><u>Giant Pandas-</u> When I visited the panda breeding center in Chengdu, a few of the pandas were sitting in a much more reclined position than I've shown, with piles of bamboo on their laps. They really don't do much more than lie down, eat, and occasionally walk around from what I got to see. Also, the muzzles look like dog or wolf snouts; I swear the original looked better....<br><u>"HERE'S DRAKO"-</u> Around this time I started suffering from a crack withdrawal. So I made my own. Mind you, I didn't have a reference (other than my cruddy memory) for any of these drawings, so it doesn't quite look like a Hydreigon... but eh, it was strangely easier than drawing a creepy Ditto. Not much you can do with two dots and a line....<br><u>Some Kind of Raptor-</u> Not the dinosaur kind, obviously. On the Guilin Li River Cruise, I saw a couple of big birds like hawks or eagles or something fishing around a certain area like crazy.<br><u>Catchin' Flies-</u> Also on the Li River Cruise, there was some guy sitting across the aisle from me (more info on the setup later) who slept the whole time. His snoring was ridiculously loud and his mouth was wide open. <strike>No need to tell me how horrible the anatomy is on this. I'm well aware there's mistakes everywhere.</strike><br><u>Attempt at Japanese Style-</u> ...I honestly have no idea when I drew this thing and the rest of the drawings. At any rate, I got extremely bored and ended up drawing an angry cartoonish cat....<br><u>The Many Faces of Derppaw-</u> Thus, I was inspired to doodle an old character of mine, Derppaw. I think he's from an old roleplay or something. For all I can say, I <i>love</i> drawing impossible expressions.<br><u>"Canon" Zubat-</u> As mentioned before, my mind was my only reference when I drew these; as such, I had a vague idea of what a Zubat actually looks like so I decided to draw it twice: once in its "canon" form, and another as I thought looked better. Unfortunately I ended up spilling some drink on my redesigned version, because the pencil lead's all blurry now. :C<br><u>Underbite Zubat (no title shown)-</u> Just a preview of a character who may or may not show up at some point in that comic I've been planning out. If he does end up making an appearance, well... Zubats have no eyes, but gain two when they evolve; what would happen to a Zubat who already has eyes?<br><br>Finally, to those who are actually interested: I'm currently in the process of typing up that promised tl;dr journal documenting the trip.</div>

    <div class="legacy-journal _2DahR _1t6xo _2CKTq"><h1>TOAST</h1><br><b><u>Unstoppable</u></b>: This Pokemon has over 9,000 EVs in every stat by default.<br><b><u><i>Wonder Guard</i></u></b>: Only super-effective attacks harm this Pokemon.<br><hr><b>Type:</b> Bread | <b>Tier:</b> Uber-Uber<br><hr><h2>Overview</h2><br>Following countless intense calculations and blasphemous algebraic nonsense, we at TotallyNotSmogon have come to a startling conclusion: Toast is the biggest threat in any and all metagames. It's so ridiculously powerful that even the mighty ExtremeKiller Arceus can only tremble in fear and run back to its mother, wailing like a newborn child. Truly, Toast is unmatched by <i>everything</i>.<br><hr><b>Destructinatoast</b> | Item: Butter | Nature: STFU<br>~Crack<br>~Sanity Hell<br>~On A Book / Internet / Strangle<br>~Explode / Toxic<br><br>This is the one and only set for Toast that can truly put an end to any and all Pokemon daring enough to stand in its way. Its signature item, Butter, restores between a quarter and half of its maximum HP every other turn, meaning it can use all four moveslots to destroy everything without having to worry about dwindling health (not that it has anything to worry about in that respect, given its more than respectable base HP). Toast is also one of the few Pokemon to have a signature Nature, STFU, which gives a boost to all its stats (at the cost of sharply decreasing N00b).<br><br>Toast could probably own every single Pokemon in existence without even having moves to begin with; it can simply Struggle everything to death. However, unless you want to make the battle even more simple than it already is, you can actually make use of Toast's four moveslots. Crack is guaranteed to confuse literally every battling Pokemon that isn't Toast, offering some awesome hax, though the 10% chance of self-confusion after the move is used is a bit of a letdown. Sanity Hell is ridiculously inaccurate, but on the occasion that it does hit it will completely destroy foes' wills to live--that is, all their stats will be dropped by -6. The third moveslot can be taken up by three moves, depending on personal preference: On A Book is basically the same as Hyper Voice but also disables all stat-boosting moves the foe may have, Internet renders the opponent immobile from three to five turns, and Strangle (known as Snuggie in-game if you have a pirated copy) is a one-hit KO move that only has a 10% chance of hitting; do note, however, that Strangle is banned in all metagames below Uber-Uber. Finally, Toxic is a choice to slowly wear down opposing Toast, though Explode is almost guaranteed to cause a K-O.<br><br>Nobody will really give a crap who you use as teammates. They'll all be running more or less the same moveset, and... oh yeah, they're exactly the same (unless you're on some "no-rules" server, but why would you be doing that, anyway?).<br><br><h2>Other Options</h2><br>Ask not what you can do for Toast, but what Toast can do for you. It can use absolutely any move viable other than Wass Beam, which is unreleased anyway so you have nothing to worry about. Seriously, this thing could just flop down and die and will <i>still</i> win because it's <i>toast</i>.<br><br><h2>Checks and Counters</h2><br>Toast has its own signature typing: Bread. Bread-type is weak only to the coveted Toaster-type, which has yet to be released anyhow. Occasionally, Toast has been defeated by Wasserbienchen, but Wasserbienchen can be commanded by no one and currently no simulator is compatible with her Wassomeness; therefore, you've really got nothing to fear if you use Toast. Just be warned that you probably won't using it against anything other than itself if you <i>do</i> decide to play the Uber-Uber metagame.<br><br><h2>Dream World</h2><br>Toast gets Wonder Guard from the Dream World, which makes it even more invincible than it already is. It's really up to personal preference as to what ability you use: if you want to go with Unstoppable, you don't have to worry about EV placement and whatnot, but if you decide Wonder Guard's your best bet... actually, screw it, EVs aren't important here, either.</div>

No, it's probably not something that would interest people looking for the kind of story that will keep you on the edge of your seat; it's more of a memoir than novel.

    <div class="legacy-journal _2DahR _1t6xo _2CKTq">They'd said that the apocalypse was coming. They'd said that the twenty-first of December, year twenty-twelve, would be the day that the world would be destroyed. They weren't entirely wrong. However, exactly <i>how</i> the end of the world came about was far more different than any sane person could have ever foreseen.<br><br> It began late that night. Nobody knows who was first or where it started, but the zombie apocalypse was in full swing by midnight. Around this time, at the break of the ominous full moon, a certain trainer and her starter were seen wandering around a graveyard.<br><br> Her name was White Jinae. The seventeen-year-old trainer had been on a relatively normal journey up until that point, and had recently defeated Nimbasa City's Gym Leader, Elesa. However, little more was known about her, aside from details from later interviews with her neighbors, Cheren Corett and Bianca Sian. Like those cliché movies about the zombie apocalypse, White and her Serperior, both missing quite a bit of skin and moving slowly as heck, wandered aimlessly through the graveyard, groaning for brains or simply moaning incomprehensibly. It might have been scary, but at the time they hadn't found any victims.<br><br> Meanwhile, Cheren had just woken up from a horrific and rather revealing nightmare. It, sadly, wasn't completely unexpected, and he suspected it wouldn't be the last, so he went out to see his therapist.<br><br> “So what seems to be the problem?” the therapist asked, looking down at a small slip of paper.<br><br> “I keep dreaming of a green-haired man in leather!” Cheren shouted, hands on his head as if ready to tear his hair out.<br><br> Seeing the psychotic look in the young man's eyes, his therapist pat his knee—it was the closest thing to a shoulder that the therapist could reach, given that he was a Minccino wearing a monocle and lab coat. “It's okay, Cheren. We're all gonna have these nightmares...”<br><br> “But it was <i>leather</i>!” Cheren got up and flipped the nearest table. “His hair was green and his eyes were blue and red and he was biting a knife and he was holding a chain and—the things he was <i>wearing</i>....”<br><br> “Cheren, sir, I think—”<br><br> “Don't <i>'Cheren, sir'</i> me! It's not the first time I've dreamed about this man, either, and I have no idea who he is!”<br><br> “Oh, yes?” The Minccino raised a hypothetical eyebrow. “What other dreams have you had about him?”<br><br> “Countless.” Cheren flopped onto a long couch and shut his eyes. “In the most recent one, there was a fire and meteors, and he swooped down on a rope to... catch me or something? It was like he was a superhero, and I was in a pink dress and high heels, and he said in a manly voice, 'Don't fret, young lady, I got this!'” He groaned. “I think I'm going crazy.”<br><br> The Minccino was silent for a few moments, scribbling furiously on the paper with a pen he had produced out of thin air. “It sounds like you're hallucinating yourself in a BROTP.”<br><br> Cheren stared at his therapist blankly.<br><br> “Regardless of whether or not you've seen this man before, either having met him or caught a glimpse of him on the streets, your mind has subconsciously decided he's your best friend. You recently lost to Elesa, correct?”<br><br> Cheren facepalmed, glasses and all.<br><br> “You're lonely. You need someone and—”<br><br> “But he was wearing <i>leather</i>!”<br><br> There was a long pause. The Minccino may have easily talked to the troubled young man thoroughly, but frankly since it was the end of the world he was beyond giving a crap. Readjusting his monocle, the Minccino sighed. “Why don't you... go outside for a while? Clear your head. Get some fresh air.”<br><br> Cheren stood, pulling down his sleeves. “Yeah... yeah, you're right. I... I need to think this through alone for a while.” He began to leave the light blue void that was the scene's setting. “Thanks. Should I schedule another—”<br><br> “Nonono! Begone,” the Minccino said, though he waved his paws even more quickly than he spoke. “Can't stress you out much more. Oh, and, uh, watch out for zombies!”<br><br> <i>Zombies?</i> Cheren almost turned back, but shook his head and kept walking. <i>No, Cheren. You're losing it. Heck, your therapist isn't even human. Just get some nice, fresh, mind-cleansing—</i><br><br> His thoughts were cut off when he found himself shoved back, and before he knew what was happening he had fallen into a newspaper stand.<br><br> “Ch-Cheren! Sorry!” Readjusting his glasses, Cheren made out a blonde girl with an orange shirt, looking at him nervously but constantly glancing over her shoulder.<br><br> He squinted. “Bianca? What are you—”<br><br> “<i>Braiiiinssss....</i>” A low groan was heard from not far off; Cheren looked up and regretted it immediately, grabbing a newspaper instinctively and with trembling hands he rolled it up and stood near Bianca.<br><br> Shuffling towards them at the speed of Munchlax was none other than White, who was in horrible shape. Zombification was not kind to her; she no longer had eyes, her face was bony, her right arm was mostly bone, and she was struggling to walk on account of large sections of skin missing from her left side and leg.<br><br> “What the—” Cheren sputtered, about to point the newspaper at White as if it were a gun, but Bianca grabbed his arm and began running away.<br><br> “It's... the zombie... apocalypse!” she gasped between breaths.<br><br> “Could've guessed.” Cheren clenched his fist around the newspaper roll more tightly. “But it's... it's a hoax!”<br><br> “White's not a <i>hoax</i>!”<br><br> They stopped short, faced with the stereotypical dead end in a dark alley. Cheren held the newspaper by his shoulders like a baseball bat, backing up slowly. “Did... did we lose her?”<br><br> “<i>I want your braiiinnnssss!</i>”<br><br> Somehow, White had caught up, and she now wielded an actual baseball bat. It made her pathetic hobbling even worse but she managed to drag it around without losing an arm, but when she caught sight of the two (or so it seemed; there were only black voids where her eyes should have been), she swung the bat over her back and lunged forward.<br><br> Cheren aimed the newspaper steadily, not wanting to make the first move—considering his former acquaintance was a zombie and therefore no faster than a Shuckle, he had time to strategize. Did he feel any remorse for what he was aiming to do? Absolutely not. This was the person who had once slapped him mercilessly. Aside from that, she was heading straight for Bianca—who cared if the blonde had ditched him for the gay Gym leader who had slaughtered his Pokemon? He'd try his best not to make things awkward after bashing the zombie's skull in, anyway.<br><br> “Come at me, glasses murderer!” he taunted, not sure how much longer he wanted to stand around and hope White suddenly didn't become much faster. “Newspaper is the ultimate weapon!”<br><br> Before anyone could react, there was an explosion somewhere. At the Pokemon League, while Cheren had a therapy session with a Pokemon and aimed to become the anti-zombie hero that Bianca deserved, the Elite Four had gone mad. Champion Alder had been calmly enjoying a tangerine when he happened to look up and see the Elite Four stripping their clothes and mounting colorful ponies. He subconsciously strangled the orange fruit. <i>Not again.</i><br><br> “Caitlin! Shauntal! Marshall! Grimsley!” the angry ginger man shouted, storming out of his grand temple and down countless stairs quickly as possible without tripping. “What the <i>hell</i> do you think you're doing <i>now</i>?”<br><br> “We're sick and tired of holding back, <i>Champion</i>,” the closest Elite Four member, Caitlin, said, hissing out the last word. “We are the Elite Four Apocalypse Riders, and with the help of our ponies, we'll end the world once and for all!”<br><br> Alder whistled through his fingers, summoning his own pony; it couldn't maintain a consistent appearance but he was able to mount it regardless. “This is madness.”<br><br> “This is crack!”<br><br> “Will ya'll please hurry up?” Shauntal yelled. “Twilight and I've been practicin' for the Armageddon Rodeo for years, and we ain't about to miss it now!”<br><br> “You're not going to end the world,” Alder spat. “Not if I have anything to do with it.”<br><br> “You'll never take us alive!” Caitlin cackled, cracking the reins of her pink pony so hard they broke off. “On, Pinkie; on, Twilight; on, Applejack and Rarity! We've got a world to destroy!”<br><br> With that, the four ponies and riders leaped into the sky. While Grimsley and Marshall rode along like any normal person aside from the fact they were devoid of clothing and on a flying horse, Shauntal refused to resist practicing her rodeo skills and grinned wildly as she held on with only one hand, and Caitlin... well, Caitlin had something special in mind for anyone who liked their women old and barely censored.<br><br> Alder tried his best to catch up, but it was to no avail—when Grimsley finally got sick of the chase he flung back a bomb, which vaporized both Alder and his pony on impact. Fortunately, his ghost was able to save a certain Pokemon.<br><br> Meanwhile, back in some room with a fireplace, it turned out that Serperiors were able to “dezombify” themselves without having the ability Shed Skin, and a few remaining spectators were awed by this phenomenon. One photographer was able to confirm that the Serperior they were seeing indeed had been a zombie—the picture showed what appeared to be a semi-romantic moment between the Serperior, whose markings were exactly the same as the one all over the news, and a Lilligant. The Serperior was loosely tied in a thin red ribbon, ending in a fancy bow on his neck, and packed into a small blue box. The nearby Lilligant was completely stiff on account of the Christmas lights wrapped around her body and plastic star lodged in her head. She seemed to be unmoving voluntarily, however, despite the fact that if Pokemon could talk she'd certainly be telling the Serperior to fuck off.<br><br> Bianca would later report that, before becoming a zombie, White had been trying to make her Pokemon feel festive before inevitable doom. Her attempts at getting them in a Christmas spirit involved cramming the Serperior, Champ, into a box and making the Lilligant, Veera, look like a Christmas tree. Unknown to her, however, Veera was Jewish.<br><br> By the time all of this had happened, the Apocalypse had been largely forgotten. Among the lucky survivors who had close encounters was none other than Cheren Corett, but he did not emerge unscarred. He wasn't sure whether or not he was dreaming, but on Christmas morning, he was greeted by the green-haired man from his dreams, who leaned against the wall with one arm and happened to be standing underneath a mistletoe that Cheren was quite certain hadn't been there before.<br><br> Against his heterosexuality, Cheren happened to notice that the man wore no clothing of any sort—arguably worse than leather—and was “censored” only by an all-too-thin ribbon. “Ay, Cheren,” he said in a strangely familiar voice, “look what I got you for Christmas.”<br><br> Cheren dragged his eyes from the man's crotch. <i>I'm straight. I'm not gay. I do not want the D.</i><br><br> Before he could speak, an older man's voice called from offscreen. “N, my boy! You're going to miss Plasma Style!”<br><br> N rolled his eyes and looked over his shoulder in exasperation. “Dad, stop interrupting me when I'm trying to seduce my bro!”<br><br> “<i>Oppan. Plasma. Style.</i>”<br><br> N looked at Cheren and winked. “I'll be back,” he said smoothly, then turned and left the panel.<br><br> Cheren promptly pinched himself, wiped his glasses, and looked for the nearest brain bleach.<br><br><br> Though the world did not end that day, thanks to the efforts of a previously-mentioned water bee and a strangely-colored Hoppip, things did not go entirely back to normal. When later interviewed, Bianca and Cheren reported that White was not defeated—when she finally noticed the newspaper, she turned and escaped using Run Away.<br><br> Other zombies still lurked Unova, even if by that point a vast majority had been sent to the grave. White happened to be one who remained aboveground, as well as another unidentified female. In a rather grotesque shot by an anonymous bystander, by the light of the full moon, the two were embraced in an awkward zombie hug and apparently in the middle of the slowest makeout in history. Two unidentified brains formed a heart above their skulls. (In response, Bianca would comment that “brains” may have been a sick metaphor for “love,” given the brains' shape in the photograph, but nobody really gave a crap about symbolism because that's too deep and logical for crack.)<br><br> The Elite Four did at last give up their madness. Alder, as a ghost trying to find whatever was after death, happened to stumble upon a water bee Pokemon and saved her from being overwhelmed by the Crackocalypse. In return, she and her friend Creepip, a purple-and-yellow Hoppip, finished what Alder could not.<br><br> “This is your last warning!” Creepip yelled, smiling cutely as she shoved an M-rated cannonball down a very special cannon. “We have crack cannons...”<br><br> “And we're not afraid to use them!” Wasserbienchen finished, yanking a lever and firing the ball straight at the Elite Four. It exploded in a huge burst of rainbows and sparkles, which showered down on a certain three people below.<br><br> An adorable Bulbasaur, who had temporarily been put in charge of Wasser's Box of Crack, was one of the explosion's closest witnesses. “Uguu!” it would later report, having apparently squealed in delight, demonic red eyes gazing in wonder at the fabulousness.<br><br> Oh yes, and those three people?<br><br> “It's about time you showed up,” complained a sadistic brunette, hands on her hips as Ghetsis and N entered the scene. She seemed unfazed by N's lack of clothing. “Tokyo, get dressed.” She flung a white, flowy shirt and gray shorts at him. “We're doing Gangnam Style.”<br><br> “My name is not Tokyo!” N said, dressing quickly.<br><br> “Of course it is, son,” Ghetsis said, standing beside his much younger waifu. “It makes about as much sense as this young lady, who's about your age, being your mother. Besides, haven't you told White that you want to become capital of Japan someday?”<br><br> N stared at them for a moment. “Didn't White punch me in the... no, wait, never mind.”<br><br> “You know I'm violent to anyone and everyone,” White said, grinning. “Now get in line.”<br><br> “Hit it!” Ghetsis shouted as everyone got into position. He flicked down his sunglasses and out of nowhere played a Ghetsis-themed version of “Oppan Gangnam Style.” Fabulous crack sparkles showered the inter-dimensional family (though they only seemed to affect N's pants) as they Gangnam Style'd until dropping dead or something.<br><br> And that is why you don't let me into Livestreams on the Apocalypse!</div>

Our favorite heated bread is now faced with new checks, but if these forces can be kept off the field by teammates (thank Arceus for variety in this crack-forsaken tier) Toast can continue to be a dominant force, causing unfortunate foes to bow in humility or Screech in terror like children whose Roggenrolas were stolen by nonexistent shippings.<br><hr><b>Standard Destructoast</b> | Item: Butter | Ability: Unstoppable | Nature: STFU<br>~Crack<br>~Sanity Hell<br>~On A Book / Internet / Snuggie<br>~Awesome / Toxic<br><br>Toast's classic set from 2012 continues to be one of its most frequently used methods of obliteration, now with a twist: Awesome. Despite a seemingly crippling accuracy of 5%, the move manages to be viable, as it's not only a guaranteed OHKO but makes Toast sparkle. No, it doesn't become shiny, it <i>sparkles</i>, not unlike everyone's favorite fabulous Bug-type Gym leader. At any rate it's much more reliable than Flash*.<br><br>Teammates matter in this revamped tier, as Toast now has has checks (see the appropriate section) other than itself. Fortunately, these new Pokemon can also be used on Toast's side. The IBAWassertoast core (IBAW, Wasserbienchen, and Toast, in case the name wasn't a dead giveaway) has become incredibly popular due to the fantastic synergy between the three, but they must always watch out for the TeamReignBanana (Tay-Tay/TeamHeartGold, Reign, and Banana<strike>, you lazy Porygon2</strike>) trio.<br><br>*Occasionally, IBAW and Reign rely on Flash for extra hax, especially as Reign's ability makes every move with a secondary effect cause confusion, but emphasis must be given on <i>hax</i>. Livestream is full of overpowered Pokemon who should not need to rely on hax to win their battles.<br><hr><b>ExtremeKiller: Bread Edition</b> | Item: Life Orb | Ability: Wonder Guard | Nature: STFU | EVs: 88 HP / 252 Atk / 168 Spe<br>~Swords Dance<br>~ExtremeSpeed<br>~Stone Edge / Brick Break<br>~Recover<br>That's right, Arceus' favorite sweeping set is also viable on Toast, albeit with a few minor changes to suit the metagame. Wonder Guard prevents normal-effectiveness moves with annoying secondary effects, Swords Dance and ExtremeSpeed are a dangerous combination on any Pokemon, Recover shakes off the Life Orb recoil, and Stone Edge murders some of the metagame's hugest threats or Brick Break hits for decent coverage.<br><br>Because this set relies on physical attacks regardless of the Pokemon using it, physical walls (Tay-Tay, notably) can cause problems. Burnt toast is the worst toast and competitive battling doesn't change that. Reflect is also a major annoyance, and though not commonly seen when it does show up it's one of the main reasons why Brick Break is even an option. As such, any teammate that can counter these threats is a good teammate, but unfortunately for you the author didn't feel like analyzing anything else in this metagame so just pick a Pokemon and see how it works.<br><br>Unstoppable can be chosen over Wonder Guard if you don't want to worry about those pesky EVs, but a Toast dancing with sharp objects doesn't appreciate getting burned, parahaxed/slowed down, poisoned, or put to sleep. Rock Slide is also an option for more accurate Rock-type coverage if you don't like Stone Edge's lack of accuracy, and another attacking move can be used in place of Recover if Toast is just going to murder and die in one fell swoop.<br><br><h2>Other Options</h2><br>Like the far inferior Smeargle and Mew, Toast can learn almost viable move, including the Livestream-specific ones used in Detsructoast. You could probably get away with using a RNG to decide on your moveset, replacing inferior options like Splash or Rock Polish for Livestream moves. Toast is just that Awesome ("pun" fully intended).<br><br>Additionally, the most (second to Toast itself) ultimate weapon, Newspaper, made its debut in the tier as an item that boosts the accuracy of OHKO moves, so a moveset consisting only of Snuggie, Fissure, Guillotine, Horn Drill, and Sheer Cold (pick four, any four) is acceptable if not highly luck-based.<br><br><h2>Checks and Counters</h2><br>Alas, no longer can Toast flop down and die and still win; there's a reason Explosion was taken off Destructoast's viable moveset. Toaster-type was deemed redundant during the tier revamp, so anything weak to it (read: Toast, the only Bread-type) is now weak to Steel. Because Wasserbienchen has been officially released, the Steel-type Doom Desire and untyped apocalypse-bringer Wass Beam stop Toast in its tracks (er, crumbs?). Banana with maxed-out Speed EVs leads to a speed tie (seriously, did you expect the trademark unaware-pedestrian-flipper to be slow?), and if Toast can't go first it will fall to Emolga Hell.<br><br>Toast also doesn't appreciate Soak, which not only makes it Water-type but also soggy, a ridiculous status condition that negates its ability and rids it of sparkle. Fortunately this move is incredibly rare due to the amount of far superior moves that Pokemon of this tier can make use of, but when it does show up it tends to drown Toast in the sorrows of merciless ocean water and a stranded brotp.</div>

Also, I drew the other one when I finally thought I was gonna make this story A Thing, and here we are now. :T Not to mention that the two on the right only recently got an upgrade in plot relevance....<br><br>Bleh, it's something.

Because it's not like I've been thinking about posting something like this for ages...! 8'D<br><br>Speaks for itself, I think. I'm not exaggerating when I say that a majority of my Human Anatomy Improvement (arguably 90%, though I <i>did</i> take a figure drawing class last semester) is thanks to pokemon people. Thanks, player characters, for being blank slates just waiting for me to impose countless notebooks' worth of headcanon upon, to the point where I honestly don't know whether to call half these people fan or original characters. (The distinction is trivial as far as I'm concerned, but that's another ramble for another time. The point is that I could translate a majority of these people into a not-pokemon world and for the most part their characters would still work.) C:&lt;<br><br><sub>You may or may not recognize Shauna, whose canon hair I tried drawing a grand total of once before saying "fuck it."

    <div class="legacy-journal _2DahR _3bG54 _3if5g">So about three years ago I watched this awesome "anime" (which is in air quotes because if you pick an anime trope, any anime trope, it is probably not present in this one), Naoki Urasawa's <i>Monster</i>, and to date it is one of the most fantastic things I've ever watched. At the time I was decidedly not confident in my human faces or anatomy or anything, unfortunately, so I was quietly resigned to not drawing any fanart.<br><br>Fast-forward to the present and as of yesterday I got a friend into it, prompting me to revisit some of my favorite parts, and then it hit me: I am actually fairly confident in my people-drawing skills now! You can see what that led to. &gt;8D<br><br>Seriously, if you want a psychological drama full of ethical dilemmas, character depth (even for the one-scene wonders!), and a surprising amount of optimism considering the gritty backdrop, I highly recommend <i>Monster</i>. It's good.<br><br><sub>The perspective on that gun killed me... the things I do for screenshot redraws....</sub><br><br><a href="https://www.deviantart.com/users/outgoing?http://a-flyleaf.tumblr.com/post/149773704121/" class="external">finger gun motions</a></div>

    <div class="legacy-journal _2DahR _3bG54 _3if5g">Even before the hiatus, I've been wanting to draw some full-body references for some of <i><a href="https://nightauctor.deviantart.com/gallery/59137803/The-Firebird-Effect?offset=48">The Firebird Effect</a></i>'s characters. Countless weeks later, my internet gave me the Christmas gift of going to complete and utter hell for &gt;2 days straight, but at least it was enough of a kick to hyperfocus &amp; finish all of these on the 24th. &gt;8V<br><br>Things To Note:<br>* These were drawn as standalones and are ordered by first appearance, so any places where characters seem to be looking at each other are entirely coincidental. (Yes, I know this makes it look like Kojo is smiling at Shauna. It makes more sense if he's to the far left but that would've messed up the whole "chronological by introduction" thing. Don't read into it. OTL)<br>* Heights are relative. I have my "headcanons" but for all intents and purposes the exact numbers are up to the imagination. I just like having something a bit more specific than "X is taller than Y is shorter than Z" etc.<br>* Palettes are "default" and thus unlikely to be used to the exact hex code in-comic, because I like playing with color schemes and refuse to do the lazy low-opacity layer mode thing <strike>that I used in the first scene</strike> ever again.<br>* But wait, there's more! Expect updates as more characters are introduced. ;y<br><br><sub>yells softly about what category this even goes in</sub><br><br>-<br>2/11/17 - Made a few tweaks to Alec &amp; Serena.</div>

    <div class="legacy-journal _2DahR _3bG54 _3if5g">Because I always post stuff like this to tumblr but it felt more relevant to dA for various reasons.<br><br>DESCRIPTION DUMP AHOY.<br><br><b>row 1</b> - A couple "speedpaints" because I really need too loosen up more in the painting department. Didn't time either but tried to limit the time taken. First is a blue dacnis, referenced from <a href="https://www.deviantart.com/users/outgoing?https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:Dacnis_cayana.jpg" class="external">this photo on Wikimedia Commons</a>, and second is the photo <a href="https://www.deviantart.com/users/outgoing?https://www.flickr.com/photos/thelotuscarroll/9195268459/" class="external">"Haunted In One Way Or Another" on flickr</a>. I found both image links buried in my bookmarks yesterday (5/20, it's passing midnight as I type this description) for no apparent reason but I probably wanted to do a color study or something so ~ta-da~<br><b>rows 2-8</b> - Front views of dragons on Flight Rising, which I don't think I've mentioned here before but it's basically dragon neopets and I love it. (Psst, if you join, refer <a href="https://www.deviantart.com/users/outgoing?http://flightrising.com/main.php?p=lair&amp;tab=userpage&amp;id=138250" class="external">Archaeoraptor</a> and I will toss you 100 food point.) These have also been posted on <a href="https://www.deviantart.com/users/outgoing?http://archaeoraptor.tumblr.com/post/160933940899/" class="external">my FR blog</a>, if you wanna check that out; as always, there are more scribbles lying around my blog that dA will probably never see. ;V<br><b>row 9</b> - And thus begins a saga that started around afternoon today when I went digging through google drive for a <a href="https://nightauctor.deviantart.com/gallery/59137803/The-Firebird-Effect"><i>TFE</i></a> tidbit and found an unzipped backup of art from my old computer. That dratini was my first tumblr icon and I thiiink I might've used it on the Nuzlocke Forums...? I was totally forgetting I have an account there, whoops. Furry on the right was one of my earliest attempts at anthro anatomy and, well. I hadn't practiced humans back then whatsoever never mind blending 'em with canines. :I I'm still not used to combining those weird limb structures, honestly, but I'd like to think I'm better than I was in... 2011? 2012? Yeah. Old stuff.<br><b>row 10</b> - Zero blep? Zero blep. Because after all these years I still remember how to draw that lizard, more or less. Red wolf on the right begins a little saga I call "shout-out to younger me and my shameless sparklewolves" - I spent a majority of my internet time pre-dA on assorted roleplay forums, yes. "Raizel" here was one of many short-lived characters who I wouldn't have remembered if not for the <strike>terrible</strike> icon edit just sitting in my files, and I know for a fact the original photo was stock of some sort but I can't for the life of me track it down again. &gt;:T<br><b>row 11</b> - If not a roleplay forum I could probably be found on a pet sim. I got the two technicolor disasters on the left from Furry Paws; I forget if I spent actual virtual money on Alex and Charlie's designs but, seeing as I did literally nothing with them beyond saving the reference pictures, hopefully not. Meanwhile, significantly less technicolor wolf on the right is Auto Silouitt, yet another aforementioned short-lived character. He seems like a grumpy old fart though and it took me until today to realize the surname is probably a play on <i>silhouette</i>. ~The More You Know~<br><b>row 12</b> - More random designs? More random designs! I'm honestly not sure if Jinx and Ranger were roleplay characters, but the dramatically lit maned wolf was actually featured in one of my first deviations. <a href="http://fav.me/d46tosd">Behold.</a> (In other news, is it just me or do digital artists tend to go from aggressively watermarking everything to not really caring about signatures/watermarks to, if they get popular enough, <i>needing</i> to watermark everything as theft prevention? Funny how that works.)<br><b>row 13</b> - Last but certainly not least, my good ol' half-namesake Slade Auctor! looking grumpier than usual and now with eyes that don't seem to be slapped onto the face as an afterthought. And then there's a design that would probably be deemed an "edgy nightmare," especially with colors, but y'know what? You wanna know what this whole revisiting old characters thing is like a gift to my younger self, and while I was definitely influenced by the anti-wolfaboo crowd (as nothing more than a lurker, shh), I think I did alright, bloody chained dragon-hellhounds and all. (Yes, his name really was <i>Massacre</i>. No, I really can't drudge up a single memory of doing anything with him, not even making the reference in that one wolf maker sparkledog-loving youth love.)<br><br>So, yeah. Art! \o/</div>

(Each of those words is a different link.) <i>How.</i><br><br>Anywho, decided to go "back to basics" for this one ft. a really cool technique-thingo(?? I have no idea what to call it) I learned in class this semester! Doodled some quick gestures while zoomed out to get the overall layout down (hence the faded pixel sketches), then just went in at 100% zoom on one layer. Took <i>much</i> less time than the past couple years' "sketch it all separate then fuck around in GIMP to put it together" method and probably maybe looks better. :Y<br>Also scrapped the whole "these are Specific Characters" thing and went with generic mostly-faceless people. You can kiiinda make out the occasional individual face shape but for the most part I figured drawing Actual Characters wasn't necessary. And/or I was lazy. :I<br><br>In any case, definitely wasn't too concerned with getting the proportions perfect here, which... definitely defeats the point of an <i>anatomy practice</i> sketchdump but oh well that's why I take figure drawing classes. (The fencing lunge is the only one I used a reference for, which I can't link because by "used a reference" I mean "stared at the google image search results page a little.") Gestures, man! Gestures are important!! And not that I'm some kinda anatomy expert, but I'm confident enough in it that my priority nowadays is movement.<br><br>Except the hand.

    <div class="legacy-journal _2DahR _3bG54 _3if5g"><div>Plot twist: I do animation sometimes \o/ I basically never post it (anywhere, and definitely haven’t on dA), but I got the urge to actually Finish One today (or at least try) and at <span class="username-with-symbol u"><a href="https://www.deviantart.com/starmoths" class="u regular username">starmoths</a><span data-gruser-type="regular" data-show-tooltip="" data-quicktip-text="" class="user-symbol regular"></span></span>’* suggestion it’s a woof. Specifically a Finley, an RP character of mine who popped up in <a href="https://www.deviantart.com/nightauctor/art/doge-dump-850548284">these</a> two <a href="https://www.deviantart.com/nightauctor/art/doge-dump-2-853897493">sketchdumps</a>; I’m not using her for writing anymore but she makes a good guinea pig.

I’m not sure how much I’ll be changing other than adding color (might add a blink or mouth movement at the end or something; heck if I remember what shred of context I started out with) but I’ve been staring at &amp; rewatching this too much to know if it’s too fast or what.</div><div><br></div><div>More artist notes because I can: Wolf realism is not my strong suit and thus the blocky/angular style happened. I’m not thrilled with the eyes being ovals when everything else is Not That, but (as you can probably see from the blinks) that’s mostly just to make sure the dot eyes don’t look too “floaty;” we’ll see how that translates in color. Speaking of eyes, the eyebrow movement at the end got thrown off by leaving the sketch layer on, but <em>oh well</em> consider that an early preview; I’ll probably upload a video of The Process when this is all done. And anyway, context be damned, this checks the “expression change animation” box I wanted to tick off today, and I didn’t even have to cry over clothing or hair or human face angles or anything ᕕ( ᐛ )ᕗ<br></div><div><br></div><div><br></div><div>*edit: SORRY DEVIANTART USER HAWKMOTH FOR THE RANDOM NOTIFICATION IF YOU GOT IT.

    <div class="legacy-journal _2DahR _3bG54 _3if5g"><div>I mentioned <a href="https://www.deviantart.com/a-flyleaf/art/sketchdump-roundup-04-2021-Long-Mode-878015249">last month</a> that I got Krita and it has nice brushes. This month has been FOCUS PING-PONG but in the midst of it all, figured I’d put some of those brushes to use through little speedpaints, since it’s been ages since I last did a proper (as in not ~650x500) digital painting from a photo reference. Ultimately I ended up using like… two brushes, predominantly, but <em>ayy</em> gotta love colors :y</div><div><br></div><div>Unofficial self-imposed guidelines: no preset palettes (so all the colors were picked by eye or already on the canvas, not directly from the reference <em>or</em> a set swatch), was mostly zoomed at 50% or less (mostly so I could fit both it and the reference onscreen simultaneously, but also for the sake of this next point), and <em>no perfectionism allowed</em>. I don’t do digital painting a lot because I get lost in the details and usually end up not liking it after hours of rendering, so (barring that dream outlier) this was a little attempt to stretch the comfort zone and whatnot.</div><div><br></div><div>But yeah, wanted to post these separately since the file size is pretty big; not sure if speedpaint-dumps will become a regular thing (or maybe I’ll start posting them separately if I like ’em enough?), but here ya go~<br></div><br><div>Obligatory sources (and context):<ul><li><a href="https://www.deviantart.com/users/outgoing?https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:Hairy_Woodpecker_(8468754362).jpg" class="external">hairy woodpecker</a> (saw one at a birdfeeder, very cool)</li><li><a href="https://www.deviantart.com/users/outgoing?https://soundcloud.com/interval-audio/arcrux-guillotine" class="external">Arcrux - Guillotine</a> (is a song, found it forever ago via <a href="https://www.deviantart.com/users/outgoing?https://sounddesignerjeans.tumblr.com/post/186098593528/sounddesignerjeans-sounddesignerjeans" class="external">this post</a>)</li><li><a href="https://www.deviantart.com/users/outgoing?https://www.gettyimages.com/detail/photo/bridger-teton-national-forest-at-sunrise-wyoming-royalty-free-image/594833583" class="external">Bridger-Teton National Forest</a> (randomized Windows lockscreen 1/2)</li><li><a href="https://www.deviantart.com/users/outgoing?https://www.shutterstock.com/image-photo/laguna-colorada-on-eduardo-avaroa-national-1344463298" class="external">Laguna Colorada</a> (randomized Windows lockscreen 2/2)</li><li><a href="https://www.deviantart.com/users/outgoing?https://www.flickr.com/photos/127379026@N05/37834169725" class="external">aardwolf</a> (think it was in a post somewhere but I forgot to bookmark it, F)</li></ul></div><div><br></div><div>Did some other photo-reference-paintings this month but not on big canvases, sooo look forward to those whenever I get around to the obligatory <a href="https://www.deviantart.com/a-flyleaf/gallery?q=%23roundup">monthly roundup</a>!

    <div class="legacy-journal _2DahR _3bG54 _3if5g"><div>The first time I alluded to the characters from this thing actually being Called Something it was <a href="https://www.deviantart.com/a-flyleaf/art/sketchdump-03-2021-no-alignment-speedrun-874931330">this guy</a> and he was still going by the placeholder moniker “Jock.” It’s only fair he gets to be the first to have an Actual Name Reveal.</div><div><br></div><div>ANYWAY. OK. SO.</div><div><br></div><div>This is basically another “comic test,” in the vein of <a href="https://www.deviantart.com/a-flyleaf/art/hello-reddit-i-have-jaundice-890815714">this one</a> except it features an actual shitpost-free scene. Presenting things in chronological order is for Dedicated Projects, a thing which this is still technically not, but I’m having fun messing around with it writing- and art-wise anyway.</div><div><br></div><div>THAT SAID there were sorrrta some conflicting priorities here. There was going to be an attempt at crowd shots but then I realized it looked weird with the way I was lining it so it became Mass of Blob. (I mean, pov character is not paying attention to any of those randos, but it’s still vaguer in the first couple panels than I would’ve liked.) I knew from the getgo I wasn’t going to color the characters cleanly like ^the other linked test, but I’m still not 100% sure about having them all solid like this. Probably my main gripe with how this turned out is that it’s kinda muddy, not just in a color scheme way. Maaaybe instead of doing a line → color pipeline, I’ll try something like sketch &amp; dialogue → block in values/colors → <em>then</em> lines, clarifying details where needed and leaving the rest to value?<br></div><div><br></div><div>Oh, and then there’s, uh, -gestures towards middle right- That One Bit. Theoretically it makes sense in the context of the full story, although I’m not sure how I’d want to handle that aspect visually. For now have <a href="https://sta.sh/01kfy59695rx">this</a> (which waaaaas done <em>after</em> the big panels, and it kinda shows because I was completely winging it on the page).<br></div><div><br></div><div>Anyway, the dialogue stuff (abstract speech bubbles + character “fonts”) is the most successful experiment here, imo. Everything else, take it or leave it. Definitely did <em>not</em> expedite the process in any way. Having said all that, I’ve been thinking I should do more experiments not just with standalone doodles but with Whole-Ass Sequential Art™, since doing a cool effect or varying art style for the shits is a <em>whole</em> different ballpark than doing a cool effect or varying art style for Storytelling™. Inevitably it will take a long-ass time, but maybe with ample experimentation it will eventually take a less-ass time, and also still look cool.<br></div><div><br></div><div>TL;DR Experiment Failed (semi-)Successfully… 2!!</div><div><br></div><div><br></div><div>Time taken: ~5h35m, over the past 3 days<br></div></div>

And with my own dang “template,” as a compromise between coding yet another Entire Thing (got that out of my system with <a href="https://www.deviantart.com/users/outgoing?https://a-flyleaf.github.io/shriblets/2021-12-28-tenyears/" class="external">the 10-year showoff</a>, for now) and sticking with one piece per month. Text sizes are based vaguely on both how many deviations I uploaded each month (October in the lead at 11, February/June/August tied for least at 4), and yes I know October/November are in the wrong order. Next year maybe I’ll buck the chronology entirely for maximum size consistency, but for now I just wanted to get this out &amp; done ᕕ( ᐛ )ᕗ<br></div><div><br></div><div>Since I typically follow up on the previous year’s notes, even though I’ve been more active here lately and so most of this probably isn’t new:</div><div><ul><li>Project status, project status… gestures towards <a href="https://www.deviantart.com/a-flyleaf/journal/Hi-I-wrote-a-blog-post-901563419">this</a> and yeets</li><li>I am not sure I’ve gotten better at backgrounds-as-in-scenery, but I’ve <em>definitely</em> been using more backgrounds-as-in-color-or-pattern; <a href="https://www.deviantart.com/middynos">Middynos</a> specifically has been a big inspiration on that front ;V</li><li>Fell in love with the square brush during ArtFight in July, have used it <em>a lot</em> since.

I dunno, can’t say shit in this economy considering how 2020 went, but I’ll see how it plays out. Also, I’ve linked <a href="https://www.deviantart.com/users/outgoing?https://www.oliverburkeman.com/books" class="external">this book</a> before (<i>Four-Thousand Weeks</i>, in case the page changes), but I’m doing it again because it has seriously not left my mind.

OKAY.</div><div><br></div><div>While I am still not 100% sure how to present ~the Actual Canonical Story~, I <em>did</em> want to actually draw out a scene from it. Specifically this one, because it’s 1) one of the earliest, and so kiiiind of works as a standalone (though I thought the preceding context was important enough to throw in anyway, even if it’s tonally dissonant as presented), and 2) the general first part has barely changed since the story’s inception. (You might recognize the major beats from <a href="https://www.deviantart.com/a-flyleaf/art/sketchdump-02-2021-is-this-a-character-developmen-871817795">February last year</a>, setting and character design tweaks notwithstanding ;V)<br></div><div><br></div><div>There is one caveat to the “canonicity” of this, and it’s that the food can be… basically anything, really?

Then the rollercoaster took a sharp turn downwards this past week, between -gestures vaguely at world- and death in the family.

As with last year’s, it probably actually looks better at thumbnail size/from a distance since you can actually make out the month abbreviations then, but I spent too long calculating upload counts and pixel-arting the text to Not use it &gt;:V Colors are kinda muted compared to last year, though on the whole I don’t think there’s been much difference. Also, as per usual, I went back and forth on a bunch of months to the point where choices were made based almost more on compositional neatness than whether the piece was actually My Favorite™ (haha jk I can never pick just one).</div><div><br></div><div>Also, can I just say there was an absurd amount of compilation-esque art here (multiple smaller drawings on one canvas), not even including the roundups?? Some of it’s a byproduct of, say, not wanting to upload commissions separately, but there’s also a good amount of canvases where I planned that from the getgo. Neat and fun (and also a good way to make backgrounds interesting without scenery) &gt;:0<ul><li>Far as ~project~ stuff is concerned, I’ve spent the last ~4 months and counting (started writing in September, page-coding and drawing in October onward) working on <a href="https://www.deviantart.com/users/outgoing?https://a-flyleaf.github.io/ygbtdm/au/" class="external">an AU for my “main story,”</a>, and it’s taught me a lot that I can and probably will write a whole blog post about. well, when it’s like, Done™. And until then I’m just gonna say that I’ve had the actual canonical main story more or less finished for months now, give or take some scene-level details, and you’ll see <em>something</em> of it sooner or later ¯\_(ツ)_/¯</li><li>So, yeah, have not practiced scenery for beans but that’s where transparency and patterns and other compositional screwery comes in. Certainly wouldn’t <em>hurt</em> to practice more but TBQH half the time I’d rather let the details fall into impressionistic abstraction anyway, so, shrug?</li><li>Very, <em>very</em> happy that aforementioned AU has finally let me put that style-as-narrative sort of thing into practice; partially unintentional (it was more painterly until I realized that was taking <em>way</em> too long), but I <em>love</em> excuses to whip out the scribbly chaos. Brush-wise, still love the square brush, and always messing with sketchier-looking textures.</li><li>Keeping up with comments/people/General Communications continues to be a self-impoesd all-or-nothing rollercoaster. I’ve been getting out more irl lately and we’ll see how that affects The Internet Activity—but dw, I basically grew up in/on the general hellhole that is The Interwebs, I can almost definitely never leave y’all for good ;V</li><li>I don’t think I’ve gotten into any new media this year?? This is somewhat voluntary (always have this lingering feeling that I Could Be Doing Something Else), and of course there’s always my own &amp; friends’ stuff to nerd out over, but branching out a bit probably wouldn’t be <em>awful</em>.</li></ul>I feel like “[doing something different] wouldn’t be Terrible, actually” is basically an ongoing theme of, if not the whole year, these last few months? I graduated For Good in the spring, what the fuck, and recently I’ve caught myself thinking of like, 19-year-olds as young. You know, when I gave my current protag a quarter-life-crisis, it wasn’t supposed to Actually Apply To Me several months later!! &gt;:V Cons of writing people roughly in and/or slightly older than your own age range etc.</div><div><br>Far as general year-in-review rambling is concerned, that’s probably best saved for aforementioned hypothetical future blog post. But to follow up on some thoughts from last year: consequences/culmination of $stuff is pretty much behind me at this point, which is bittersweet, as vaguely-negative $stuff tends to be. This holiday season was actually pretty decent, in that I actually did spend it with friends both online and off; last year, iirc, the whole season passed like normal-ass days, except everyone was stressed as usual and it felt shitty because You’re Not Supposed To Feel Bad At This Time Of Year. And like, it’s not like the latter half of this year <em>hasn’t</em> been somber; two grandparents and my dog passed away within the year, so, that’s. sad.</div><div><br></div><div>…Damn, there really isn’t a good way to continue from that, is there? Uh, having hung this lampshade—2022 did not feel like a refresher/reset/rejuvenation <em>at all</em>, but as life do, the bad stuff was interlaced with some eye-opening experiences, for worse <em>and</em> for better. You know, it’s one thing to talk about how great friends are and how important it is to push the comfort zone, self-introspection and breaking/replacing unhealthy habits and all that jazz, but it’s another to, y’know… <em>do</em> all that. I’ve written a few stream-of-consciousness blog posts throughout the year that I haven’t been itching to advertise because I don’t think they’re particularly comprehensible to anyone who isn’t me, but that’s… fine, tbh. They don’t have to be.</div><div><br></div><div>I don’t know, I’ve never been particularly personal in these descriptions. I keep typing things and then backspacing furiously because That’s Blog Post Material, Save It. But like, I think artistically I haven’t made any particular major jumps, and normally/previously I might beat myself up about that a little but like: who cares. It makes me fucking sad to see people putting themselves down because they’re not painting level+100 masterpieces every day. I’m increasingly… <em>allergic</em> isn’t the right word, but like, cringe and irony and detachment and all that? where someone does something they’re clearly loving but preface it with a thousand semi-joking self-deprecating disclaimers to ward off external judgment before anyone else can lift a finger? I empathize, and that’s why it makes my skin crawl.

I <em>think</em> I’m finally crawling out of the artblock abyss, but earlier in the month I was like “hey, if all I feel like is drawing headshots, isn’t that a good excuse to do <a href="https://www.deviantart.com/users/outgoing?https://web.archive.org/web/20230711155453/https://nitter.net/heyitspegkat/status/1638785959452897282" class="external">that one ‘the cast in your style’ meme</a> that I’ve been eyeing for months.” So here are the people I’ve been drawing copious amounts of for like 8 months now, except all together in full color \o/<br></div><div><br></div><div>Copypasting part of the description from <a href="https://www.deviantart.com/users/outgoing?https://a-flyleaf.github.io/omori/art/headshots" class="external">my site</a> (though as usual, it’s extended over there):</div><div>-<br></div><div>Didn’t use the actual template for a couple reasons; firstly because I have no idea who made it (the version linked above doesn’t seem to be the original; there are faint traces of someone else’s art on it), and moreover because, as per <a href="https://www.deviantart.com/users/outgoing?https://www.omori-game.com/en/updates" class="external">the fanwork policy</a>, I try not to use official assets anywhere. Also, thought it’d be cool to do a sort of style comparison, one which draws (har har) more from the game canon and the other with more of my own liberties.<br><br>Incidentally I figure the Headspace crew looks more or less exactly as presented in-game, so! Twofold comparison combo &gt;:3c<br><br>Pencil-esque coloring style on the real-world took forever but was surprisingly fun! Relatively flat shading was ?inspired by (feels like the wrong word, nothing was directly referenced, but these styles were In Mind at the time) the official talksprites + <a href="https://www.deviantart.com/users/outgoing?https://web.archive.org/web/20230711154528/https://nitter.net/pic/orig/media%2FFWj7cDDVsAEVU4l.jpg" class="external">Faraway fullbodies</a>, as well as various art by @udtcue (on <a href="https://www.deviantart.com/users/outgoing?https://www.tumblr.com/udtcue/" class="external">Tumblr</a> + <a href="https://www.deviantart.com/users/outgoing?https://nitter.net/udtcue" class="external">(not-)Twitter</a>).</div><div><br></div><div>Time taken: 7h30m, most of which was probably all that pencil-style coloring. Turns out scribbling like that is relaxing, even if it kills my hand a little \o"/<br></div><div>-</div><div>As a side note I do not use default palettes for any of them, so skintones and such vary wildly across scribbles. The official art isn’t consistent either, though (relative value ftw), so ¯\_(ツ)_/¯<br></div></div>

It’s not public because I haven’t asked the original artist if they’re cool with that, but colors and base markings in that old ref did not change whatsoever. <i>Copious</i> amounts of liberties taken since, and will continue to be with reckless abandon 🥳<br></div></div>
