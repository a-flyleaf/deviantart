    <div class="text">*insert smiley spam here*<br><br>My birthday was on the 12th, and one of my gifts was the amazing book <i>DragonArt: Evolution</i> by <a href="https://www.deviantart.com/neondragon"><img class="avatar" width="50" height="50" src="https://a.deviantart.net/avatars/n/e/neondragon.png?5" alt=":iconneondragon:" title="neondragon"></a>. She recommends drawing with a tablet, so I took advantage of the chance to ask my parents for one.<br><br>It's not a super-fancy, super-expensive Wacom; just a simple DigiPro WP5540 Pen Tablet that my uncle had and never used. It's taking a lot of getting used to so far since it's much more sensitive than my laptop's trackpad, but once I start to figure things out I'll post things I make with it (assuming that they don't look horrible)!<br><br>        </div>

    <div class="text">I haven't drawn anything for the past few days. I've missed Livestreams left and right. I've been dead to the (Internet) world. There are two things I blame: packing and <i>SoulSilver</i>.<br><br>I'm sure you'd all <i>love</i> to hear about how it turns out I've got absolutely nothing to wear for the trip (which I wrote about in an earlier journal)... and considering that I'm one of those people who detests clothes shopping, I can't say I've enjoyed the constant outings. But I digress.<br><br>Recently dug out my old-as-dirt <i>SoulSilver</i> game and am playing through it again. I might Nuzlocke it later on, but for now I'm doing a normal runthrough because I have practically no idea what the plot is about anymore. |D As I've mentioned before, I haven't played a GenIV game if <i>forever</i>; I was forgetting that I even had <i>SoulSilver</i> in the first place, and my <i>Platinum</i> was sold at a yard sale a few years ago.<br><br>anyway. I'm glad you're still reading this because guess what: SHINYSHINYSHINYSHINYSHINY *spazzes out*<br><br>Last night, at around 10 PM, I was level grinding my Arbok on Route 28. First lucky thing: he finds a Shiny Leaf shortly after beating the crap outta a herd of Tauros. There was a giant pile of bull carnage and it was amazing. That snake is awesome.<br><br>Suddenly, a wild Hoppip appears. IT'S GREEN. IT'S A GREEN HOPPIP AND IT'S SPARKLY AND OH MY GOD THAT'S A SHINY.<br>Caught the little bugger in a Quick Ball to avoid killing it by mistake.

She says that Luna's a Hoppip (albeit purple and yellow instead of shiny and green). I mean, that's why I named the Hoppip Luna in the first place, but still.... &lt;/useless rambling that you are still reading for some reason&gt;</strike><br><br>In other news, I recently figured out how to make my tablet pressure sensitive (turned out all I needed was to download some sort of driver), only to have it confiscated because some relative needs to draw something for a project or some other crap. &gt;:I When I get it back, I'll probably make a quick doodle of my <i>SoulSilver</i> team (and possibly make it detailed if you creeps demand so). And <i>THEN</i> I will finally finish that darned Livestream bundle. <strike>Here's hoping I can manage to do all this before I leave for China in less than two weeks....</strike> |D<br><br>...<br><br>Okay now, I'mma shut up and go accomplish things... and then play Voltorb Flip for ten hours. :I<br><br>        </div>

Have you ever caught a shiny Pokemon?

Pokémon Red, Blue or Yellow?<br>Blue, based on color alone; I've never played any of the three |D<br><br>87. Pokémon Sapphire, Emerald or Ruby?<br>Emerald<br><br>88. Gold, Silver or Crystal?<br>Crystal, since (I think?) you can get all three Legendary beasts.<br><br>89. FireRed or LeafGreen?<br>FireRed<br><br>90. SoulSilver or HeartGold?<br>SoulSilver, though I'm biased (haven't played HG)<br><br>91. Diamond,Pearl, or Platinum?<br>Platinum<br><br>92. Black or White?<br>Black<br><br>93. Favorite Kanto starter?<br>Charmander<br><br>94. Favorite Johto starter?<br>Cyndaquil (also quite fond of Chikorita, despite its crippling weaknesses at the Gyms)<br><br>95.

What names have you given your rival?<br>Kanto: Gary, <a href="http://fav.me/d384eyo">Assbrains</a>, Dick...<br>Johto: Silver, [same as above], and TROLOLOLOL (because toast)<br><br>101. Proudest Pokemon moment?<br>When my underleveled Samurott destroyed Alder's final Pokemon, a Volcarona, with one (critical hit) Surf. I'd <i>like</i> to say "when [insert Pokemon here] reached level 100", but I don't have that much patience. |D<br><br>102. Favorite character in the anime?<br>That one background person who appeared in episode #9,000. You know, the one who didn't say anything and thus didn't have the opportunity to annoy me.<br><br>103. Least Favorite character?<br>Ash, though everyone gets on my nerves....<br><br>104. Gary or Ash?<br>Gary.<br><br>105. Have you ever thought if Ash gotten to Oak's on time?<br>...what.<br><br>106. In addition to the last question, what Pokemon would you think he would've chosen?<br>Brick. It's useless, does nothing important, and can really irritate people. IT'S A MATCH MADE BY ARCEUS, PEOPLE.<br><br>107. Favorite Pokemon fan art?<br>Look at my Fanart folder. See how it's flooded with Pokemon? Clearly I am not in a position to pick ONE. :I<br><br>108.

SHUSH. I swear I'll post it before I leave for vacation tomorrow. |D</strike><br><br>Anyway. Recently I've been thinking of starting a comic.

I'm not sure if it's even going to be a Hoppip; I've just been using one in the idea sketches and whatnot because of the shiny one I found in <i>SoulSilver</i> (which gave me the idea in the first place). Of course, any other ideas are fine with me; it's just got to be a small Pokemon native to Johto and preferably not ridiculously complex to draw.<br><br>Here's an example: <a class="external" href="https://www.deviantart.com/users/outgoing?http://i.imgur.com/WirdE.png">i.imgur.com/WirdE.png</a> Yes, that's <span class="username-with-symbol u"><a class="u regular username" href="https://www.deviantart.com/luna-pon">Luna-pon</a><span class="user-symbol regular" data-quicktip-text="" data-show-tooltip="" data-gruser-type="regular"></span></span>.

Yes, the file's unnecessarily big; I meant to shrink it but <strike>TOAST</strike> meh. And finally, yes, I was lame and forgot to turn on tablet pressure until I was pretty much done. There's no shading or detail or anything else fancy like that; if I do end up making this a series, I'm not shading it because it'd take too much time and suck up my motivation. <strike>My handwriting is awful I know shut up I tried to make it look good and failed miserably okay? okay.</strike><br><br>Shuttin' up now. So. Thoughts on whether or not I should go through with this? (Keep in mind that I probably won't be able to actually start this thing until I get back from vacation... which won't be until April 29th. Oi. <strike>Why do I keep coming up with ideas when I know I won't have the time to actually make them real. |D</strike><br><br>        </div>

I once spent three hours straight playing Solitare (not the Spider Solitare kind). I didn't keep track of how many games I played, but I didn't win a single one. D:<br>2. I enjoy imitating accents, specifically British, French, Boston (or at least heavier than it is already, considering I live in northern New England), and occasionally Indian.<br>3. I play piano.<br>4. I collect business cards, which has actually come in handy a few times.<br>5. I can't speak any language aside from English other than maybe a few basics like numbers 1-5 and "hello", though I've decided that I'm going to learn a decent amount of Mandarin Chinese by the end of 2012.<br>6. I keep saying I want to be an editor as a side job when I grow up (with the main occupation being author), though I don't quite understand most English grammar in thorough detail; I can usually know when something sounds wrong and correct it more often than not.<br>7. I can go from a crack-high-induced insanity to deadly serious in a few minutes, though I swear I'm not bipolar.<br>8. I'm slightly bow-legged, and when I walk and run my toes point out at about a 45 degree angle. When I'm sitting, I can put my feet out in a straight horizontal line... not sure how unusual this fact is but my family can't do any of this comfortably. vOv<br>9. I seem to move in and out of fandoms on a monthly basis; for a few months, I'm interested in dogs and wolves and other canines, then I'm more interested in <i>Warriors</i>, then I've abandoned both and moved onto Pokemon (current obsession)....<br>10. I'm often mistaken for being 16-19 for some reason....<br>11. I can never seem to draw Pokemon correctly from memory, even those with simple designs like Eevee or Porygon2; there almost always ends up being some sort of minor alteration from the canon design.<br><br><b>D's Questions</b><br>1: If you could date anyone in the world, who would it be?<br>Nobody. I have no interest in dating.<br><br>2: If you could learn a language, any language, which would it be? (You may choose mulitple.)<br>Chinese (see Fact #5)<br><br>3: How are you feeling today?<br>Bored. Tired but unable to fall asleep.<br><br>4: If you could move [to]/visit any place in the world, where would it be?<br>Now that I've seen China, I wouldn't mind going to Italy.<br><br>5: Marvel or DC Comics?<br>Neither. The only comics I read are in the local newspaper and on here. |D<br><br>6: If you could be sent to any fictional world (video game, comic, novel, cartoon, manga, anime, own creation e.g.) where would you want to end up?<br>Eh... somewhere where I wouldn't die, have to fight for a living, and could have modern technology...? I wouldn't even be interested in living in the Pokemon world; live among giant, sometimes fire-breathing monsters that could easily cause an apocalypse if they suddenly decided they didn't like living with people? No thank you....<br><br>7: Werewolf or vampire?<br><strike> <a href="https://www.deviantart.com/faceshovelplz"><img class="avatar" width="50" height="50" src="https://a.deviantart.net/avatars/f/a/faceshovelplz.gif?2" alt=":iconfaceshovelplz:" title="faceshovelplz"></a> I MEAN UH...</strike> Werewolf, I suppose. I like canines.<br><br>8: Do you use Facebook just so you can play the games?<br>Screw Facebook. DEVIANTART FOREVAR. (In other words, I'm not on Facebook and probably never will be.)<br><br>9: Do you care what other people think of you, do the oppinions of others affect you?<br>Well, to a degree; if I didn't give a crap about other peoples' opinions I'd be a pretty awful person, wouldn't I? <strike>I'd hope I'm decent....</strike> However, if I don't like something, I'm very slow to be convinced otherwise. Peer pressure? Pffft, no. For example, I've pretty much found babies to be the most annoying things in the world and not at all cute since I was a little kid, and regardless of how much others say that babies are adorable and they're only annoying because they can't talk, I'm still pretty darned irritated. <img src="https://e.deviantart.net/emoticons/b/blankstare.gif" width="15" height="15" alt=":|" data-embed-type="emoticon" data-embed-id="402" title=":| (Blank Stare)"><br><br>10: If you lost the ability to use any technology do you believe you could suvive in a 'dark age' setting, returning to your primal roots to work and live with nature?<br>If I was suddenly thrown into such an era at the current time, absolutely not. I hate bugs, don't like being in the sun too long despite the fact I don't get sunburned too easily, and am a picky eater; I'd probably be miserable for a while before starving to death. <strike>I'm a pathetic individual. |D</strike><br>If you're asking if I could survive assuming I'd been born into that kind of setting, though... well, I wouldn't have much of a choice, would I?<br><br>11: If Ragnarok was upon us, who would you side with? Loki, Fenris, and the rest of the gaints or Odin and the gods?<br>Eh... I don't know much about Norse mythology. Sorry. D|<br><br><br><b>My Questions</b> <strike>for the poor suckas down there.</strike><br>1: Would you rather be on an airplane for forty-eight hours straight or on a boat for the same amount of time? (You're not going anywhere along the way; just taking off and making a giant u-turn at some point to head back.)<br>2: If you had to permanently give up English for another language, which would it be?<br>3: If you could meet and have dinner with a person from the past, present, or future, who would it be?<br>4: If you were going to be trapped in a small room, alone, for twenty-four hours, and told you could bring one item small enough to fit in a regular-sized backpack, what would you take with you?<br>5: If you were told to design a mural on some important/famous large building (White House, for example), what would it be of?<br>6: If you were the leader of your country for a day, how would you use your temporary power? (Be realistic; you can't just say "no more homework" and outlaw it simple as that.)<br>7: If you had to eliminate one non-parasitic living thing from Earth, what would it be?<br>8: If you had to give up a common form of technology (i.e. television, computer, telephone, electricity) for a week, which do you think you would have the <i>hardest</i> time living without?<br>9: If you had to drink one liquid besides water for the rest of your life, what would it be?<br>10: If you were told you would someday be famous for one thing only, what would you want that thing to be?<br>11: Can you tell a lie with a straight face?<br><br><b>[_], I Tag You!</b><br>1. <span class="username-with-symbol u"><a class="u regular username" href="https://www.deviantart.com/tokiball12345">Tokiball12345</a><span class="user-symbol regular" data-quicktip-text="" data-show-tooltip="" data-gruser-type="regular"></span></span><br>2. <span class="username-with-symbol u"><a class="u regular username" href="https://www.deviantart.com/luna-pon">Luna-pon</a><span class="user-symbol regular" data-quicktip-text="" data-show-tooltip="" data-gruser-type="regular"></span></span><br>3. <span class="username-with-symbol u"><a class="u regular username" href="https://www.deviantart.com/bonegard">Bonegard</a><span class="user-symbol regular" data-quicktip-text="" data-show-tooltip="" data-gruser-type="regular"></span></span><br>4. <span class="username-with-symbol"><span class="banned username">FreeInProgress</span><span class="user-symbol banned nolink" data-quicktip-text="Banned or Deactivated/Closed Account" data-show-tooltip="1" data-gruser-type="banned"></span></span><br>5. <span class="username-with-symbol"><span class="banned username">MaximumRevolver</span><span class="user-symbol banned nolink" data-quicktip-text="Banned or Deactivated/Closed Account" data-show-tooltip="1" data-gruser-type="banned"></span></span><br>6. <span class="username-with-symbol u"><a class="u core_plus username" href="https://www.deviantart.com/pkmnmasterwheeler">pkmnMasterWheeler</a><span class="user-symbol core_plus" data-quicktip-text="Core Plus Member" data-show-tooltip="1" data-gruser-type="core_plus"></span></span><br>7. <span class="username-with-symbol u"><a class="u regular username" href="https://www.deviantart.com/shnananana">Shnananana</a><span class="user-symbol regular" data-quicktip-text="" data-show-tooltip="" data-gruser-type="regular"></span></span><br>8. <span class="username-with-symbol u"><a class="u regular username" href="https://www.deviantart.com/teamheartgold">TeamHeartGold</a><span class="user-symbol regular" data-quicktip-text="" data-show-tooltip="" data-gruser-type="regular"></span></span><br>9. <span class="username-with-symbol u"><a class="u regular username" href="https://www.deviantart.com/ayamander">Ayamander</a><span class="user-symbol regular" data-quicktip-text="" data-show-tooltip="" data-gruser-type="regular"></span></span><br>10. <span class="username-with-symbol u"><a class="u regular username" href="https://www.deviantart.com/kalithe">Kalithe</a><span class="user-symbol regular" data-quicktip-text="" data-show-tooltip="" data-gruser-type="regular"></span></span><br>11. <span class="username-with-symbol u"><a class="u regular username" href="https://www.deviantart.com/velink">Velink</a><span class="user-symbol regular" data-quicktip-text="" data-show-tooltip="" data-gruser-type="regular"></span></span><br><i>Don't feel obligated to do this.

I can understand if you've been wanting to change your dA name for a while, but I've seen people changing their names because "this is a cool new feature and I want to try it" or "I've already changed accounts a bunch of times but now I don't have to anymore" and <i>those are both crappy reasons</i>.

In a few years from now we'll have some people with notes on their pages that say "Formerly <b>kawaiidesugal9000</b>, <b>warriorz4lief</b>, <b>pokeymanzrule</b>, <b>starlightmoonwolf51</b>..." etc. (Forget the fact those are all crappy usernames and someone who wants to use them should really think twice; that's just sarcasm.) Point is, do you really <i>need</i> to be changing your username so often? <img src="https://e.deviantart.net/emoticons/s/stare.gif" width="15" height="15" alt=":stare:" data-embed-type="emoticon" data-embed-id="594" title="Stare"><br><br>Yeah, I know I'm ranting, and I don't know why you're still reading this. I'm just pretty darned sick of seeing a bunch of messages in my Inbox saying that people I watch just changed their username, usually to something worse than the original. Do I use thousands and thousands of names on the Internet? Yeah. Do I need to be changing my dA name every six months to reflect my current most-frequently-used name? <i>Heck no.</i><br><br>(And for those who are wondering: No, I'm not just saying this because I don't have a premium membership. Screw premiums; I can put up with a few ads and no journal skins/polls/etc. I'd still be complaining about this sort of thing nonetheless.)<br><br><sub><sub><sub><code>USERNAME BAG&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;F*CK!</code></sub></sub></sub><br><br>        </div>

    <div class="text">Recently I downloaded the new version of GIMP and <i>oh my god IT'S AWESOME.</i> The brush dynamics took a while to figure out, but I think I've got the hang of things now. I really like the options to lock a layer (preventing you from, oh, I'unno, <i>drawing on the sketch layer</i>) and layer groups (because now there aren't countless layers squished into a cramped list; I tend to use way too many of 'em.... <img src="https://e.deviantart.net/emoticons/a/animesweat.gif" width="19" height="19" alt="^^;" data-embed-type="emoticon" data-embed-id="417" title="Sweating a little...">)... if you use GIMP, go to the website and download v2.8 now. :I<br><br>ANYWAY. I'm pretty caught up on work in the <a href="http://fav.me/d4yuegx">upcoming comic</a> and I don't want to go too overboard with drawing in advance, but I really feel like drawing now that I have this awesome new update. 8D So, anyone wanna request a drawing?<br><br>I <i>will</i> draw pretty much anything you ask as long as it's not mature (i.e. no naked people, excessive violence, that sort of thing), so go crazy; crack, serious stuff, vhatevar. <img src="https://e.deviantart.net/emoticons/b/bucktooth.gif" width="15" height="15" alt=":B" data-embed-type="emoticon" data-embed-id="570" title="Bucktooth"><br>&gt;inb4 "OMG DRAW MAH HOMESUCK TROLL/SPARKLEPONY" &lt;-I mean, fine, shove me <i>way</i> out of my comfort zone and request a person <strike>or, ARCEUS FORBID, a pony</strike> but if you do you definitely shouldn't expect something of fantastic quality. The whole point of me doing this is to experiment drawing different things (and possibly in different styles(, after all....<br><br>Just don't go asking for a full-blown watercolor painting of a South American dawn with tigers dancing around in the background, because this'll all be digital and I've never been one to make incredibly complicated stuff in the first place. :I I'll try to do my best to not screw up <strike>any more than I usually do</strike>, but otherwise I make no promises.<br><br>Other than that, I've got no idea how long I'll be open for this. Depends how many requests I get. :3 So, without further rambling, if you're interested, just tell me and I'll get working ASAP~<br><br>        </div>

I was going to post it in my gallery but eh, didn't write it and whatnot. :I<br><br>"12th Birthday Celebration"<br>For deviantART's 12th birthday, the staff decided to throw a glorious surprise party for Fella. They gathered at Fella's favorite restaurant, The Fancy Naub, with presents in hand. Llama brought Fella to the door and once they stepped in, all of the staff screamed, "Mother of mew!!" Fella was so shocked that he instantly flattened. He opened his presents to find that Llama had given him 12 bananas. He was amazed! He would never forget that night.<br><br>"The Big Match"<br>Once upon a time, there was a young boy named ChereN who always dreamed of becoming the world's best drunkard. He trained every day for over 9,000 hours in order to beat his rival, The Fugly Menace. The day of the big competition arrived, and ChereN came armed with a cake and his unstoppable determination. They were pitted against each other in a battle of wits, and ChereN emerged as the insane victor! His achievement is celebrated every Livestream.<br><br>"Wise Advice"<br>My great-grandfather used to tell me, "Don't chase after stalkers because you'll only end up with a Hoppip in your eyeball." I never quite understood his advice until one summer, I was gardening with my best friend KAWAII-DESU-BAKA-CHAN. All of a sudden, we found an underground tunnel! It was creepy and spooky sounds came from deep within. KAWAII-DESU-BAKA-CHAN saw something interesting inside, jumped in, and I never saw her again. Great-granddaddy was right!<br><br>"Artistic Inspiration"<br>A young woman named Lesbianca loved making art, and practiced erasing all day long to become the very best in all her town. But one day, she was completely stumped. She looked around her room, full of art pieces featuring mystical Snuggies, sci-fi landscapes of a futuristic Wasstralia, and a portrait of Eles(bian)a that looked so real, you could start a conversation with it. But nothing inspired her. Had she really created everything there was to create? Depressed, she looked out her window, and made a wish on a nearby toast for inspiration to return to her. The next morning, she sprung out of bed, and used her skill in erasing to create the most beautiful deviation depicting books stripping anyone had ever seen. That night, she shouted out the window, "Thanks, toast!"<br><br>...<br>I<br>do<br>not<br>even<br><sub>The last one is my favorite. /brick'd</sub><br><br><div>Skin by; <span class="username-with-symbol u"><a class="u regular username" href="https://www.deviantart.com/nishithv">NishithV</a><span class="user-symbol regular" data-quicktip-text="" data-show-tooltip="" data-gruser-type="regular"></span></span></div>        </div>    </div>    </div></div>

    <div class="text">Been there, done that. Didn't do much more than grind and catch a few abominations, but it was fun while it lasted! Thanks again to everyone who showed up~ :3<br><br>ALSO, I kept referring to a Let's Play of <i>Quartz</i>, which can (and should) be read <a class="external" href="https://www.deviantart.com/users/outgoing?http://lparchive.org/Pokemon-Quartz/">here</a>. It's got a few spoilers in terms of "plotline," locations, evolutions, etc. but it's arguably more hilarious than the game itself so GO READ IT. <img src="https://e.deviantart.net/emoticons/b/biggrin.gif" width="15" height="15" alt=":D" data-embed-type="emoticon" data-embed-id="366" title=":D (Big Grin)"><br><br><strike><sub>Yes, I'm actually <i>Livestreaming</i> for once.

BD<br><br><sub>Apologies in advance for any technical difficulties that come up; I downloaded an older version of Livestream, and while it seems to work fairly well this is the first time I've tried streaming a game.

    <div class="text">Just a quick heads-up that I'll probably be dead to the dA for most of November <strike>as if I wasn't already kinda scarce during October</strike> because NaNoWriMo is pretty much the greatest writing motivation ever. Any of you guys trying it this year? :3<br><br>For those who don't know, it's basically a challenge that tries to get participants to write a novel of at least 50,000 words in a month. Sure, it stresses quantity over quality, but it's only a first draft so things like that can get sorted out later. <a class="external" href="https://www.deviantart.com/users/outgoing?http://nanowrimo.org/">Here</a>, if you're a writer, go check it out if you haven't already; sure, November already started, but it's not too late to sign up! ;D<br><br>Oh yeah, and about the title. Some of you might know that I'm addicted to the minigame Voltorb Flip on <i>Pokemon HeartGold</i>/<i>SoulSilver</i>. The topic came up in some Livestream recently and people thought there was no such thing as level 8 <strike>because apparently a majority of people are too lazy to actually use their brains and play the game as it's meant to be played</strike>. <i><b>There is a level 8.</b></i> I think it's just something that comes up randomly, though, because I didn't get to it until beating level 7 at least three times in a row. Just felt like sharing that, for future reference. NOW TO FIND OUT IF THERE'S A LEVEL 9 AND BEYOND! /shot<br><sub>Screw "pics or it didn't happen;" it happened on an actual game cartridge and I couldn't be bothered to photograph it, so you'll just have to take my word for it. Maybe someday I'll actually make it to Goldenrod City on a ROM. <i>Maybe someday.</i></sub><br><br>...How do you even conclude journals that aren't memes/Livestream-related? :V<br><br>        </div>

    <div class="text">Life update sort of thing I guess? Does anyone actually read these? :V<br><br>Well, uh. Been gone for a few months. Long story short, allow me to flip schoolwork and my old computer with the deepest of prejudice.<br><br>Came back to &gt;3,000 messages, panicked, and deleted 'em all by mistake <strike>except it wasn't really a mistake</strike>, so I've missed a lot of stuff like countless comic updates and just artwork/journal entries in general. Yeah. I'm coordinated.<br><br>Anyway, in the mean time, I've been doing a crapton of sketching, mostly of those creatures with wretched anatomy called <i>Homo sapiens</i>. I'll see what I can do in terms of scanning some of the less-horrid attempts (especially since there were actually a couple I didn't hate, who would'a thought) but I can't make a single promise. :I Ah, technology, simultaneously the bane of my existence and the best way to spend free time.<br><br>Finally, even though I'm ideally going to be a bit more active on here than I've been the last few months (read: checking messages more than <i>maybe</i> once or twice in a blue moon), the only drawing program on the computer I'm using is MS Paint and I can't download anything better, so I probably won't be uploading much for a while. Hopefully I'll be able to get a new computer in the summer, but in the mean time most of my drawing will be traditional and unless I can make this scanner work I won't be posting much.<br><br>Since that got longer than I thought, <strike>tl;dr I'm back from my unannounced departure from the face of the Internet and will ideally be posting stuff regularly again in the summer</strike>.<br><br><sub>Now to go try drawing on MS Paint and raging at how prehistoric it is compared to basically every other art/photo editing program in existence!

    <div class="text">Because I didn't want to recycle that other journal again. :V<br><br>Anyway, my old computer's working again. Doesn't change the fact it's old and that I basically lost all my files regardless, but at least I don't have to wait until summer to have my own computer even if it <i>is</i> a craptop. I probably won't be terribly active on the Interwebz anyway since finals are coming up <strike>and I'm drowning in schoolwork</strike> but I'll at least be around to reply to comments and dig through my inbox. Ideally. OTL<br><br>As far as uploading things goes, I managed to get GIMP and my tablet driver back over the weekend, though the only thing I've drawn digitally so far is a Mother's Day gift so I'm probably not going to upload that <strike>despite the fact I'm actually kinda really proud of it and feel like being a show-off. /brick'd</strike> Meanwhile I'm trying to digitally paint a hawk in actual color so this could be interesting (with emphasis on <i>trying</i>, however, because screw feathers; I'll probably upload a WIP later). In terms of scanning things... yeah, that's not gonna work out because my scanner refuses to cooperate with my computer, and I don't feel like taking photos of any of the sketches so no traditional art for you. :I<br><br>For those who care, probably won't be on Skype much, if at all, for a while (kinda paranoid about downloading things at the moment), so if for whatever reason you need to contact me immediately just send me a Note on here or something. <strike>If you <i>do</i> see me on Skype, tell me to get my lazy self back to the studying I'm putting off.</strike><br><br>Uhh... I think that's about it.

Trying (mostly in vain) to improve on the first three, may eventually try the fourth, and I'm never going to draw digitally without a tablet because that's a pain.</div><div><br></div><div><b>What is/are your most common problem(s) with putting art out?</b></div><div>Laziness. Sheer and utter laziness. I especially tend to procrastinate on things I can't make look right so a lot of the unfinished files I've got lying around on my computer will never see the light of the Internet.</div><div><br></div><div><b>Why do you draw/paint/create?</b></div><div>I'm probably "supposed" to write some big long story about how, one day, at a time when my life was all sucky and emo, I discovered the wonders of art and have been inspired since. The reality is that drawing is a fun way to spend my free time so I just kinda do it because I can. <strike>That was inspirational, no?</strike></div><div><br></div><div><b>Who has influenced/currently influences you(r art)?</b></div><div><i>Lots</i> of stuff, but special shout-out to a lot of the people on the Internet for influencing me in all sorts of ways. <sub>I'm looking at you, Livestream. You people are awesome but this question didn't specify objectively <i>positive</i> influences.</sub></div><div><br></div><div><b>What's your favorite medium?</b></div><div>Other than writing, definitely digital art. I like sketching traditionally because it prevents me from being too much of a perfectionist unless I want a paper full of eraser smudges, but for that reason I can't finish something traditionally because <i>then</i> perfectionism kicks in. :I</div><div><br></div><div><b>What was your lowest point in art? Highest point?</b></div><div>Erm... when I was a little kid and thought that using references was for blockheads and when I discovered dA and all its wonderful tutorials, respectively? Haven't been drawing "seriously" for that long (like I take art seriously) and I wouldn't say I've hit any high/low points yet.</div><div><br></div><div><b>What advice can you offer other artists?</b></div><div>Study real life. "Style" is not an excuse for sucky anatomy; work on realistic anatomy and <i>then</i> style. Practice until your hands fall off but avoiding carpal tunnel is probably a good idea.&nbsp;Draw hands and other things you suck at because it's good practice, but keep avoiding carpal tunnel because then your hands are useless slabs of flesh.&nbsp;<a href="http://fav.me/d5bi80o">Shading isn't usually gray.</a> Yeah, I'm kinda just reiterating what other people have said because I don't feel qualified to offer general advice, and even if I <i>did</i> I wouldn't have any super-awesome brand-new undiscovered trick to tell you about. :V</div><div><hr></div><div>Aside from all that, been more or less dead to dA for the past few weeks yet again.

If your neighbor isn't the Champion at the end or if they don't at least battle you at the end of Victory Road I'll be very disappointed.</div><div><br></div>If you have the game(s) already, what Pokemon are you using?

I just....<br><br>Can we just talk about how Team Flare is probably one of the most evil <strike>and fabulous</strike> teams in the entire franchise? (I don't care what they say about "ultimate weapon;" they used a nuke and it's a good thing it didn't release poison gas everywhere or something.) Or how about parallels between their plan and the final boss in <i>Gates to Infinity</i>? Maybe Lysandre in general and how he somehow had a Mega Gyarados? (Did he make that Mega Ring himself? Supposedly there's only one, but I think I was lied to; Korrina shouldn't have been able to Mega Evolve her Lucario if there was only one Ring. Seems the neighbor got sorely cheated there.) Rambled a bit about Lysandre and Team Flare on <span class="username-with-symbol u"><a class="u regular username" href="https://www.deviantart.com/ky-nim">ky-nim</a><span class="user-symbol regular" data-quicktip-text="" data-show-tooltip="" data-gruser-type="regular"></span></span>'s poll, so <a href="https://comments.deviantart.com/14/4000983/3253635802">go read this thing</a> if you feel so inclined.<br><br>How about AZ and his last-second tragic backstory or the fact that he's like 10 feet tall? Also, Yveltal, which is pretty much the incarnation of evil. (I have <i>Y</i>; my sister has <i>X</i> and apparently Xernas doesn't consume the life of everything when it dies so that's good.) And is it just me or are little girls in Kalos really creepy? We've got the Fairy Tale girls with no pupils or whites in their eyes (like a certain disturbing Gym leader), one who feels like a Skiddo used Attract on her, and another who wants a Pokemon with Nuzzle to use it on her or something. <i>Ummm....</i> Oh yeah, and Lumiose City is awful. Even if it didn't have a game-breaking bug, I hate navigating it with a burning passion and I've been selling my soul to the taxi drivers just so I don't get miserably lost. And Mega Abomasnow? <u>did you mean: President Barack Obama</u> /brick'd<br><br>Finally, if anyone else has as much trouble with the Amie thing as I did, <span class="username-with-symbol u"><a class="u regular username" href="https://www.deviantart.com/simbathehuman">SimbaTheHuman</a><span class="user-symbol regular" data-quicktip-text="" data-show-tooltip="" data-gruser-type="regular"></span></span> posted a really good suggestion below. Additionally, if you're looking to max out Affection, Fullness, and Enjoyment, keep in mind that petting increases Affection but lowers Enjoyment, playing the minigames raises Enjoyment but lowers Fullness, and feeding raises Fullness but doesn't lower anything. So, max Affection --&gt; max Fullness --&gt; max Enjoyment in that order, whether for one Pokemon or the entire team. It usually takes about an hour or two for the whole team to get maxed out depending on the minigame; personally I'd recommend Tile Puzzle but this is coming from someone who's obsessed with puzzles, moving or not, and is pretty good at them if she does say so herself.<br><br>At the new time of writing, I'm grinding for the eighth Gym, so no spoilers beyond that (although I'm pretty sure there's not much else in here plot-wise other than Sycamore's little party and possibly AZ being reunited with his Flabebebebebebe--I mean Floette. If you're interested, my team consists of the ever-varied (in terms of typing) Linoone, Azumarill, Pyroar, Blastoise, Furfrou, and Tyrantrum; no room for Noivern, sadly, but I haven't found one yet anyway. &gt;:I Ah well. <strike>That's what post-game teams are for.</strike><br><br>So... speculation for <i>Pokemon Z</i>/sequels/whatever may come next? /brick'd<br><br>        </div>

    <div class="text">That is one of the more unnecessarily long ways to write "1 year" that I've ever used but I digress. Seeing as the previous journal is from June 2016, it's about time I posted another. V:<br><br>So first things first, I swear <a href="https://nightauctor.deviantart.com/gallery/59137803/The-Firebird-Effect"><i>TFE</i></a> is still a thing that is happening! Yes, I've been horrendous about updating recently, but no, I'm not giving up on it. My excuse is that lack of backlog + writing crises + general fun with college = <i>oh my god me of last year how did you manage</i>. 8I If nothing else I swear I'll get up at least one page a month, which is a significantly lower standard but it's something. Can't promise exactly when but it'll probably be a Monday, just because.<br><br>On a more positive note, <i>huge</i> shout-out to everyone who's been following, whether you watched me for the comic or not. I really do appreciate every comment, whether on a page or tumblr tags - and on that latter note, did you know <i>TFE</i> has an official blog AND a <a class="external" href="https://www.deviantart.com/users/outgoing?http://firebirdeffect.tumblr.com/tagged/the-fanwork-effect">fanwork tag</a>? Because it floors me every day people have drawn my loser crew and I appreciate every one. &lt;3<br><br>And a final more general note: at any given moment I am falling own the metaphorical stairs of horrendous time management. As of late your best bet for contacting me offsite is <a class="external" href="https://www.deviantart.com/users/outgoing?http://flightrising.com/main.php?p=lair&amp;tab=userpage&amp;id=138250">dragon neopets aka Flight Rising</a>. Unfortunately, no, that's pretty much not possible without an account, but then again same applies to dA and tumblr and all the other sites I'm on, and I swear I do still check this website at least once every other week anyway. (You should totally refer me if you join FR though. You might get free food! ;D)<br><br>ok cool I never know how to end these bye&nbsp;ᕕ( ᐛ )ᕗ<br><br>        </div>

    <div class="text">So! Once again, it's been a while since I went through my notifications on dA, and even longer since I actually updated my comic. (If you're not interested in <i>The Firebird Effect</i>, feel free to skip this, since it's probably not relevant to your interests.) At this point I can make all the excuses I want, but the fact of the matter is this: I've lost interest.<br><br>I could go into a big long ramble about why I've been mentally done with the comic for a while, but essentially, I feel like the story has become something it wasn't intended to be - not when I started taking my <i>XY</i> "headcanons" in a wildly offshoot direction in the first place, and not even when I started the comic nearly two years ago. It's not terribly evident based on the pages I have up so far, but it becomes <i>very</i> clear down the line. Frankly, the pieces don't mesh. And I'm not terribly inclined to either start over to make the beginning line up with the end <i>or</i> scrap my future plans to align with what's been posted.<br><br>In my book, one of the biggest creative pitfalls is when the artist is no longer interested in their work. I feel like it bleeds through somehow, whether through schedule slip or declining quality or a cheapshot ending or whatever. <i>TFE</i> is a very, <i>very</i> long way from completion in its current state.<br><br><b>However.</b> I don't think it's a complete flaming garbage heap. I'm still very interested in exploring some of the ideas it plays with, and my main reason for starting it in the first place was to get one of my stories <i>out there</i>. And I intend to follow through with that. I am going to finish this story, in one way or another, and it's going to be public, start to finish. Just not as a page-by-page comic.<br><br>Instead, my plan from here is to post some type of summary - standalone drawings of major scenes with details in the description? longer collages interweaving text and picture, similar to the way <a href="https://wasserbienchen.deviantart.com/gallery/48799533/In-Black-and-White?offset=144">a certain key inspiration comic was wrapped up</a>? frankly, I'm not sure - along with a link to a document filling in as many blanks as possible. The plot summary doc is already about halfway done, and I have drawings of various scenes throughout my files and sketchbooks. From here it's just a matter of putting it together.<br><br><b>TL;DR</b> From this point on, <i>The Firebird Effect</i> is going to be completed in summary form. It's going to be a no spoilers barred dump of as much as I can gather. Ideally I'd like to have this done by June, which gives me about two months to finish everything I've started.<br><br>And from there... who knows! I have another story in the works, albeit not pokemon-related and in heavy development. I've been thinking of setting myself a monthly goal, whether creative or getting things done in life in general, and that might yield a few shorter one-shot type works. Needless to say, I am absolutely <i>not</i> done with art or writing. I'm just ready to let this particular project go.<br><br>Big thanks to anyone who's ever shown interest in <i>TFE</i>, whether through talking to me about the cast or commenting or faving or even just giving it a passing glance. Y'all are great and I hope you'll stick around for the conclusion. But even if you don't, it's been a swell couple of years. Thank you so much. &lt;3<br><br>(disclaimer: I’m posting this in a bit of a rush. Expect some edits within a day or two. I also have a couple of pages finished; I'll likely edit this and get those posted simultaneously. Stay tuned~)<br><br>        </div>

    dA won’t let me get rid of the status bar on Eclipse, and other tragedies of web design. also, PSA your watchers/watchees(? the people you watch) are now public by default through the new layout, so that’s a thing

Except I have <em>five-hundred-thirteen fucking deviations</em> as of writing (journal entries/status updates notwithstanding; also not including a handful of backlogged stuff from 2024 onward), and do I feel like testing GitHub’s repository size limits by reuploading all those images? <em>Lol.
