Goodness heck of a darn I am terrible at making formal announcements, but here we go! <i><a href="https://nightauctor.deviantart.com/gallery/59137803/The-Firebird-Effect">The Firebird Effect</a></i> is a comic I've been planning out for about three years (on and off), and while I haven't been talking about it too much around here, I told myself I'd start this thing today so here we are~

You can check that link for more info, and <b>for the record</b> I'm aiming to post <b>at least one page each Monday</b>, ideally more for the sake of pacing, but we'll see how long my backlog lasts. :V

Hope you enjoy, but if pokemon comics aren't your thing, consider this a guarantee that I'll be more active around here now! Albeit with pokemon, every week, and if you're not into that then... welp, if you stick around, enjoy the ride? 8D
