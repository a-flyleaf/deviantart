    Incidentally, I discovered a few days ago that the magnificent Internet Archive picked up a good chunk of my blog pages, including [a version of my about from August 2016](https://web.archive.org/web/20160914003825/http://a-flyleaf.tumblr.com:80/about) (so, after this post, but surprisingly close).

...divided by 1,500. I have not made a journal entry here in approximately 2 years (well, closer to 1.5, but <i>whatever</i>) so here we go!
<br>
<br>
Last time I wrote, I said the following: 1) someday I'll probably vanish off the Internet without warning, 2) I'd vanished from dA and gave my notifications, favourites, and watch-ees(?) a huge wipe, 3) if you want to stay in touch, tumblr's your best bet, and 4) I might upload some traditional and/or 3DS work one of these days.<br>Well, here's an update: #1 is looking more unlikely the more Internet Fame<sup>TM</sup> I accumulate, #2 my favourites and whatnot are probably not going to be half as full any time soon and frankly I don't intend on trying, #3 still stands (<a href="http://a-flyleaf.tumblr.com/about/">and here's a link</a>; it's all over the descriptions of my latest works so there's no point in being cagey), and as for #4... HA. Hahahahahahaha, haha, ha, ha, <i>as if</i>. <strike>Watch, now I'm gonna spontaneously get the urge to upload a bunch of it.</strike>
<br>
<br>
Anyway uhh, let's see. The main reason I'm writing again is because it's been ages, and since lots has changed since then, I'm gonna use this as a reintroduction & update of sorts. Because I miiiight be planning Something starting next month, and in light of that I probably ought to get more active around here again. But in the mean time, I suspect half of you are wondering who the heck this random person in your inbox is.
<br>
<br>
So, hello! I'm NightAuctor, AKA a <i>ton</i> of names but the most prominent at the time of writing are Flyleaf and Ace. Yes, my username is an amalgamation of two old roleplay characters who don't even exist in the same 'verse, and yes, I am horrendous at Brand Recognition. I've been on deviantART for... almost five years? Yeah, wow, just checked and I can't believe I've been around that long. o_o I was mostly active around here in 2012-2013 as a result of my involvement in the Nuzlocke community, though I'm not sure how many are still around from that because it was, y'know, 3-4 years ago. (Not that my interest in Pokemon ever went away; in fact, ever since the beginning of this year, it's back in full swing!) I have a vested in interest in technicolor cartoons and anatomically improbable creatures, and graphic design/illustration is my passion.
<br>
<br>
I draw a lot, I talk a lot, and I don't submit either my pictures or my words here too often but I'm working on that. I also happened to get interrupted in the process of writing this and completely lost what else I wanted to say between the last paragraph and this one, and honestly that's all you need to know about me as a person. <img src="https://e.deviantart.net/emoticons/letters/=p.gif" alt=":P">
<br>
<br>
But yeah, expect more activity from me from here on out!<br/>
[N/A] <sub>haha abbreviation puns</sub> OUT.
