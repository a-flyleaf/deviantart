  Eclipse is actually not the *worst* website redesign I’ve ever seen, but profile editing is glitchy as hell, and based on the settings it’s not even a properly *complete* redesign. Check out your groups and laugh with me at the blatant copy-paste of green layout!
  
  Points for trying, dA. C+. &lt;s&gt;also you bet I’m too lazy to expand this into a proper journal so a comment is happening instead, what of it&lt;/s&gt;
  
  edit: Also, turns out you can’t even preview comments or use HTML properly in them. Once I cobble together a cover image I am probably never turning Eclipse on again 👍 Extra credit for, if nothing else, letting people opt out!  
  edit2: Weirdly, comment editing is just not a thing whatsoever on the old layout. #hashtagThanksDeviantArt

dA won’t let me get rid of the status bar on Eclipse, and other tragedies of web design. also, PSA your watchers/watchees(? the people you watch) are now public by default through the new layout, so that’s a thing
