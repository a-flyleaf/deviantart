  Not as a Patreon thing, just like, For Free. This is two years now that a vast majority of my artistic output has been on a small (~650x500px) daily sketchdump canvas, and I don’t like uploading those on their own, but… >:V (Context: [see description](https://www.deviantart.com/nightauctor/art/2020-Summary-of-Art-865706374))
  
  Also, big disclaimer: the caveat about story-related doodles still *very much* applies, and because this is super informal, I make no promises. That said, you get a liiiil more art than the usual once-in-a-blue-moon upload? I get to struggle even *more* to put together end-of-year roundups that don’t feature stuff I’ve posted here, and subsequently might have to drop that “rule” altogether, but that is a Me Problem :^D
  
  I mean, I might do this regardless. Even if everyone votes <i>nah</i>. I’m just curious ;V

footnote:
  comment: A friend later confirmed he was one of two (2) votes here. No clue who the other one was!
