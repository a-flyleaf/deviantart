Follow-up to [this hasty status update](https://www.deviantart.com/nightauctor/status-update/22045369): Recent versions of FireAlpaca have [an auto-save feature](http://firealpaca.com/en/topics/Understand+Autosave+function)! It is unfortunately not *huge* help if you’ve been saving a lot, since your manual save will overwrite whatever FA did (and it doesn’t look like there’s a way to have it auto-save at regular intervals, either?? goddammit), BUT:

C:\Users\[USERHERE]\appdata\Local\FireAlpaca\FireAlpaca\autosave_backup

You’re welcome :D

Now if you’ll excuse me, I recovered one of the most time-consuming parts but not the rest of the fucking drawing, and now I am going to go scream into a cloud or something. Maybe from now on I will simply clog my files with manually-saved versions. Fuck my life. BYE
