TIL scraps are still a thing [https://www.deviantartsupport.com/en/article/what-are-my-scraps](https://www.deviantartsupport.com/en/article/what-are-my-scraps) !

Note that people won’t actually be notified of scrap uploads *unless* they’ve checked your username for it on the [/watching](https://www.deviantart.com/watching/) page, which… man, is that even accessible anymore? I don’t think it is. So scraps are like, ghost uploads or something. This may or may not be a boon, up to you; they’re still very much browsable through your gallery directly.

Anyway, I will not be using them because I thought they died when the pre-Eclipse layout did, and subsequently moved Everythign into the main gallery >:V But thought it was neat, wanted to share, ~the more you know~ /crawls back into not-using-dA-like-social-media hole
