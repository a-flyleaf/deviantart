title: Username Changes
date: 2012-05-17 14:10

footnote:
  comment: Honestly I just think this is funny in retrospect because 1) now I've changed my dA username (mostly to take advantage of the opportunity while I had it, but really wouldn't have minded still having the old one) and 2) *oh you sweet summer child*, I had yet to experience the broken link hellpit that was Tumblr urls.

So apparently, now people can change their username... <i>if</i> and <i>only</i> if they have a premium membership. (For the record, <a href="https://www.deviantart.com/simbathehuman">SimbaTheHuman</a>/thefrozentundra and I (mostly Tundra) <a href="https://comments.deviantart.com/1/301354460/2543194125">totally called it</a>. <a href="https://www.deviantart.com/sphealwithitplz"><img src="https://a.deviantart.net/avatars/s/p/sphealwithitplz.png" alt="SphealWithItPlz"></a>)

Honestly, I think people are jumping on this bandwagon <i>way</i> too quickly. I can understand if you've been wanting to change your dA name for a while, but I've seen people changing their names because "this is a cool new feature and I want to try it" or "I've already changed accounts a bunch of times but now I don't have to anymore" and <i>those are both crappy reasons</i>. (I mean, I've always been kinda biased against people who change their accounts once every twenty days or whatever, but that's another rant...).<br><br>Seriously. Put some thought into it <i>before</i> you change your name. Yes, I know you can change your name again in another six months... but you can't go back to the original. Waste of usernames much? In a few years from now we'll have some people with notes on their pages that say "Formerly <b>kawaiidesugal9000</b>, <b>warriorz4lief</b>, <b>pokeymanzrule</b>, <b>starlightmoonwolf51</b>..." etc. (Forget the fact those are all crappy usernames and someone who wants to use them should really think twice; that's just sarcasm.) Point is, do you really <i>need</i> to be changing your username so often? <img src="https://e.deviantart.net/emoticons/s/stare.gif" alt="stare">

Yeah, I know I'm ranting, and I don't know why you're still reading this. I'm just pretty darned sick of seeing a bunch of messages in my Inbox saying that people I watch just changed their username, usually to something worse than the original. Do I use thousands and thousands of names on the Internet? Yeah. Do I need to be changing my dA name every six months to reflect my current most-frequently-used name? <i>Heck no.</i>
<br>
<br>
(And for those who are wondering: No, I'm not just saying this because I don't have a premium membership. Screw premiums; I can put up with a few ads and no journal skins/polls/etc. I'd still be complaining about this sort of thing nonetheless.)
