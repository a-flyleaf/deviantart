My birthday was on the 12th, and one of my gifts was the amazing book <i>DragonArt: Evolution</i> by <a href="https://www.deviantart.com/neondragon"><img src="https://a.deviantart.net/avatars/n/e/neondragon.png" alt="neondragon"></a>. She recommends drawing with a tablet, so I took advantage of the chance to ask my parents for one.

It's not a super-fancy, super-expensive Wacom; just a simple DigiPro WP5540 Pen Tablet that my uncle had and never used. It's taking a lot of getting used to so far since it's much more sensitive than my laptop's trackpad, but once I start to figure things out I'll post things I make with it (assuming that they don't look horrible)!
