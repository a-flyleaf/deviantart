the concept of \"cringe\" externalizes shame over youthful indulgence because you are expected to grow out of anything fun and have the world\'s highest standards always and that is dumb. that is a shame. there is nothing creative under the sun that cannot be done well, and even if something is done \"badly,\" who gives a crap. does it spark joy? yes? art job done. the real cringe is cringe itself. go home everyone we have solved the internet

anyway [this is a thing](https://twitter.com/sleeprann/status/1300928083411849217); copying the prompts here in case the original prompt list implodes, as links on the internet tend to do.

24-30 are (7 free days, spaced out as you wish). day 31 does not exist.

[TABINDENT]update: apparently i am using free days as \"get out of prompt free\" cards

bonus self-imposed rules:  
\- mspaint only  
\- seeing as no preexisting characters of mine fit many (if any) of the themes, a new one will be spawned specifically for this challenge. maybe more.  
\- the art can absolutely be done in 5 minutes or less. in theory it would be very cool if the drawings got progressively \"better,\" mostly because it would make for a hell of a progression gallery-roundup-thing, but we are also in the midst of the semester and i am here to have a good time. increased pressure to make Artâ„¢ every single day is not a good time. it can, and should, be churned out in two seconds before bed if that is what it takes to draw something every day.

leave your irony at the door. we are here to have FUN

EDIT 10/14: this has somehow not petered off and also my prompt combining made a Mess so [now it has a folder](https://www.deviantart.com/nightauctor/gallery/75431402/cringetober). also "draw something every day" I LAUGH
