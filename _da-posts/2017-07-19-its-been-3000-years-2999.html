That is one of the more unnecessarily long ways to write "1 year" that I've ever used but I digress. Seeing as the previous journal is from June 2016, it's about time I posted another. V:

<br>
So first things first, I swear <a href="https://nightauctor.deviantart.com/gallery/59137803/The-Firebird-Effect"><i>TFE</i></a> is still a thing that is happening! Yes, I've been horrendous about updating recently, but no, I'm not giving up on it. My excuse is that lack of backlog + writing crises + general fun with college = <i>oh my god me of last year how did you manage</i>. 8I If nothing else I swear I'll get up at least one page a month, which is a significantly lower standard but it's something. Can't promise exactly when but it'll probably be a Monday, just because.
<br>
<br>
On a more positive note, <i>huge</i> shout-out to everyone who's been following, whether you watched me for the comic or not. I really do appreciate every comment, whether on a page or tumblr tags - and on that latter note, did you know <i>TFE</i> has an official blog AND a <a href="http://firebirdeffect.tumblr.com/tagged/the-fanwork-effect">fanwork tag</a>? Because it floors me every day people have drawn my loser crew and I appreciate every one. <3
<br>
<br>
And a final more general note: at any given moment I am falling own the metaphorical stairs of horrendous time management. As of late your best bet for contacting me offsite is <a href="http://flightrising.com/main.php?p=lair&tab=userpage&id=138250">dragon neopets aka Flight Rising</a>. Unfortunately, no, that's pretty much not possible without an account, but then again same applies to dA and tumblr and all the other sites I'm on, and I swear I do still check this website at least once every other week anyway. (You should totally refer me if you join FR though. You might get free food! ;D)
