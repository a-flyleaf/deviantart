-scrawling furiously on a chalkboard- I will not start using deviantART like social media, I will not start using deviantART like social media, I will not  
(Genuinely, the latest couple updates have been an anomaly; we will resume the usual radio-silence-sans-actual-deviation-uploads soon, probably.)

So first things first, HUGE shout-out to the kind person who got me a core membership today <img src="https://e.deviantart.net/emoticons/b/biggrin.gif" alt=":D"/> I have thus been enabled to do the one and only thing I‚Äôd ever want to do with a core membership*: change my gosh dang username.

*Once upon a time I would have also wanted to use core for like, journal skins and polls, except now everyone can do the latter and I don‚Äôt think the former is really a Thing anymore, but I digress.

It is done. The days of NightAuctor are no more. I have now turned into one of the Cool Kidz‚Ñ¢ who uses a consistent handle across most (active, anyway) platforms. You are still totally free to call me whatever the heck you want, though.

Self-gratuitous rambling below:

I‚Äôm writing this as a journal because the timing is, coincidentally, fitting enough; I haven‚Äôt been this active on dA for literal *yeras*. And while I don‚Äôt care about self-promotion, people keep finding my stuff one way or another somehow anyway, and that‚Äôs pretty cool. So, additional shout-out to my newest watchers! There is no consistency or god or master here, thanks for stopping by üëã

On that note, a little ~historical context~: I‚Äôve been using a-flyleaf sinnnce‚Ä¶ wow, apparently 2016?? *Over five goddamn years now, stop it, I feel old.* Before that (and still today to an extent, depending where I am), one of the closest things I had to a consistent username was <i>Nightpath</i>‚Äîand yes, that is a warrior cat name. That was not a phase in which I drew digitally a lot, never mind posting it, but it was a very strong phase that happened nonetheless. <s>guess my age lol</s> So that‚Äôs half my old username.

The other half is from [Slade Auctor](https://www.deviantart.com/nightauctor/gallery?q=%23sladeauctor), a coyote RP character I‚Äôve had since 2011 (you might recognize him as [my previous icon](https://www.deviantart.com/nightauctor/art/Say-what-807631756)). He was more or less a self-insert, and while I forget where I got <i>Slade</i> from, <i>auctor</i> is Latin for ‚Äúwriter‚Äù and I‚Äôll give you two guesses what his schtick was (in theory, anyway; TFW no thumbs).

Night + Auctor = NightAuctor. Solid. And the stylized little ‚ÄúN/A‚Äù makes for a very nifty signature, which I‚Äôm gonna keep using. I probably could‚Äôve kept that username too, really, since if I have anything like a ‚Äúpersonal brand‚Äù it‚Äôs Being Slapdash On Purpose. But the opportunity is here on a diamond platter, and automatic redirects are a blessing, so‚Ä¶ hello! Same weirdo, different name.

And for the record, any resemblance to a Christian rock band is entirely unintentional. I Just Thought The Word Was Neat. There‚Äôs deeper lore to the rest of it, but I‚Äôll spare ya ;V

&nbsp;

As a little thanks for reading this far, I‚Äôll turn the mic over to you (in an effort to make this a smidge less yelling-to-the-void-y and more interaction-initiation-y, and because this stuff genuinely fascinates me\*): **Where‚Äôd you get *your* username from? Is it consistent across sites, and how long have you been using it?**

\*ok I guess I‚Äôm not 100% done yet: It‚Äôs always cool to me how internet names (or lack thereof) come about and why, especially if they change over time. Because while it could very well be an inside joke or middle school name that Stuck, and anonymity online is a double-edged sword (to say the least), the internet is one of the few places where your name is really, wholly *yours*.

I just think that‚Äôs something pretty special.
