One of these days I'll probably disappear off the entire Internet without any warning. That day is not today. :V
<br>
<br>
I have, however, all but disappeared from deviantART, to the point where I spontaneously decided to delete all my messages, unwatch a <i>lot</i> of people, and nearly obliterate my Favourties. (side note: I actually did this back in July. Never noticed that this had been shoved into sta.sh until just now, whoops.) Should I ever become active here again, these are actions that I'll probably regret. Until then, though, it's nice to not have to see over ten-thousand things collecting virtual dust in my inbox and at least half my Favourites being in storage. :T
<br>
<br>
If you need to contact me for whatever reason, your best bet is to leave a comment on my profile and hope I get around to seeing it, since I'm never on Skype.<br/>My Tumblr is another option; I'm sure you can find the link if it's really that important.

There's a <i>lot</i> of artstuff that I've accumulated over the past few months between sketching on scrap paper and Colors 3D, but the chances of me uploading them here are slim. But hey, maybe I'll spontaneously feel like uploading those one of these days. Maybe not. Who knows.
