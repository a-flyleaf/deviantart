So! Once again, it's been a while since I went through my notifications on dA, and even longer since I actually updated my comic. (If you're not interested in <i>The Firebird Effect</i>, feel free to skip this, since it's probably not relevant to your interests.) At this point I can make all the excuses I want, but the fact of the matter is this: I've lost interest.
<br>
<br>
I could go into a big long ramble about why I've been mentally done with the comic for a while, but essentially, I feel like the story has become something it wasn't intended to be - not when I started taking my <i>XY</i> "headcanons" in a wildly offshoot direction in the first place, and not even when I started the comic nearly two years ago. It's not terribly evident based on the pages I have up so far, but it becomes <i>very</i> clear down the line. Frankly, the pieces don't mesh. And I'm not terribly inclined to either start over to make the beginning line up with the end <i>or</i> scrap my future plans to align with what's been posted.
<br>
<br>
In my book, one of the biggest creative pitfalls is when the artist is no longer interested in their work. I feel like it bleeds through somehow, whether through schedule slip or declining quality or a cheapshot ending or whatever. <i>TFE</i> is a very, <i>very</i> long way from completion in its current state.<br><br><b>However.</b> I don't think it's a complete flaming garbage heap. I'm still very interested in exploring some of the ideas it plays with, and my main reason for starting it in the first place was to get one of my stories <i>out there</i>. And I intend to follow through with that. I am going to finish this story, in one way or another, and it's going to be public, start to finish. Just not as a page-by-page comic.<br><br>Instead, my plan from here is to post some type of summary - standalone drawings of major scenes with details in the description? longer collages interweaving text and picture, similar to the way <a href="https://wasserbienchen.deviantart.com/gallery/48799533/In-Black-and-White?offset=144">a certain key inspiration comic was wrapped up</a>? frankly, I'm not sure - along with a link to a document filling in as many blanks as possible. The plot summary doc is already about halfway done, and I have drawings of various scenes throughout my files and sketchbooks. From here it's just a matter of putting it together.
<br>
<br>
<b>TL;DR</b> From this point on, <i>The Firebird Effect</i> is going to be completed in summary form. It's going to be a no spoilers barred dump of as much as I can gather. Ideally I'd like to have this done by June, which gives me about two months to finish everything I've started.
<br>
<br>
And from there... who knows! I have another story in the works, albeit not pokemon-related and in heavy development. I've been thinking of setting myself a monthly goal, whether creative or getting things done in life in general, and that might yield a few shorter one-shot type works. Needless to say, I am absolutely <i>not</i> done with art or writing. I'm just ready to let this particular project go.
<br>
<br>
Big thanks to anyone who's ever shown interest in <i>TFE</i>, whether through talking to me about the cast or commenting or faving or even just giving it a passing glance. Y'all are great and I hope you'll stick around for the conclusion. But even if you don't, it's been a swell couple of years. Thank you so much. <3
